     * If `true`, the system is permitted to override the app's windowing behavior and implement
     * activity embedding split rules, such as displaying activities adjacent to each other. A
     * system override informs the app that the activity embedding APIs are disabled so the app will
     * not provide its own activity embedding rules, which would conflict with the system's rules.
     *
     * If `false`, the system is not permitted to override the windowing behavior of the app. Set
     * the property to `false` if the app provides its own activity embedding split rules, or if you
     * want to prevent the system override for any other reason.
     *
     * The default value is `false`.
     *
     * <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Refusal to permit the system override is not enforceable. OEMs
