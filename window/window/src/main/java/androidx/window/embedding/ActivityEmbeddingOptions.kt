 * Puts [OverlayCreateParams] to [Bundle] to create a singleton-per-task overlay [ActivityStack].
 *

 * started by [ActivityOptions.toBundle] or [androidx.core.app.ActivityOptionsCompat.toBundle], it's
 * suggested to use the bundle to call this method.
 *
 * Below sample shows how to launch an overlay [ActivityStack].
 *
 * If there's an existing overlay [ActivityStack] shown, the existing overlay container may be
 * dismissed or updated based on [OverlayCreateParams.tag] and [activity] because of following
 * constraints:
 * 1. A task can hold only one overlay container at most.
 * 2. An overlay [ActivityStack] tag is unique per process.
 *
 * Belows are possible scenarios:
 * 1. If there's an overlay container with the same `tag` as [OverlayCreateParams.tag] in the same
 *    task as [activity], the overlay container's [OverlayAttributes] will be updated to
 *    [OverlayCreateParams.overlayAttributes], and the activity will be launched on the top of the
 *    overlay [ActivityStack].
 * 2. If there's an overlay container with different `tag` from [OverlayCreateParams.tag] in the
 *    same task as [activity], the existing overlay container will be dismissed, and a new overlay
 *    container will be launched with the new [OverlayCreateParams].
 * 3. If there's an overlay container with the same `tag` as [OverlayCreateParams.tag] in a
 *    different task from [activity], the existing overlay container in the other task will be
 *    dismissed, and a new overlay container will be launched in the task of [activity].
 *
 * Note that the second and the third scenarios may happen at the same time if [activity]'s task
 * holds an overlay container and [OverlayCreateParams.tag] matches an overlay container in a
 * different task.
 *
 * @sample androidx.window.samples.embedding.launchOverlayActivityStackSample
 * @param activity The [Activity] that is going to be used for launching activity with this
 *   [ActivityOptions], which is usually be the [Activity] of the app that hosts the task.
 * @param overlayCreateParams The parameter container to create an overlay [ActivityStack]
