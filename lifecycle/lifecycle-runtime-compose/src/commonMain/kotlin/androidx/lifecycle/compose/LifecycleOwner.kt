/**
 * Creates a new [LifecycleOwner] with a lifecycle that is a child of the parent composition's
 * lifecycle.
 *
 * This is useful for creating components (e.g., a map view) that need a lifecycle shorter than the
 * host screen. The child lifecycle will never be in a state greater than its parent, and it can be
 * further restricted by the [maxLifecycle] parameter. For example, you can ensure a component's
 * lifecycle never goes beyond [STARTED], even if the parent Fragment is [RESUMED].
 *
 * When the composable leaves the composition, the child lifecycle will be moved to [DESTROYED].
 * This ensures the child is properly cleaned up even if it is referenced outside the composition.
 *
 * @param maxLifecycle The maximum [Lifecycle.State] this child lifecycle is allowed to enter.
 *   Defaults to [RESUMED].
 * @param parentLifecycleOwner The [LifecycleOwner] to use as the parent. Defaults to the
 *   [LocalLifecycleOwner].
 * @param content The composable content that will be scoped to the new child lifecycle.
