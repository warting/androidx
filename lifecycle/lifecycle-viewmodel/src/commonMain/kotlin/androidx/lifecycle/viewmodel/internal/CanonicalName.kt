 * platforms (e.g., Kotlin/JS).
 *
 * For platforms where [KClass.qualifiedName] is available, it will return that value. On platforms
 * like Kotlin/JS where `qualifiedName` is not yet supported, it falls back to [KClass.simpleName].

 * @return The canonical name of the [KClass], or `null` if the [KClass] itself is `null` or its
