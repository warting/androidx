/**
 * A mutable back stack of [NavKey] elements that integrates with Compose state.
 *
 * This class wraps a [SnapshotStateList] so that updates to the stack automatically trigger
 * recomposition in any observing Composables. It also implements [StateObject], which allows it to
 * participate in Compose's snapshot system directly.
 *
 * Typically, you wonâ€™t construct a [NavBackStack] manually. Instead, prefer using
 * [rememberNavBackStack], which provides a stack that is automatically saved and restored across
 * process death and configuration changes.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val backStack = NavBackStack(Home("start"))
 * backStack += Details("item42") // pushes onto stack
 * backStack.removeLast()         // pops stack
 * ```
 *
 * @constructor Creates a new back stack backed by the provided [SnapshotStateList].
 * @see rememberNavBackStack for lifecycle-aware persistence.
