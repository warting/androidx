/**
 * Provider interface to be implemented by system credential providers that will fulfill Credential
 * Manager requests. The implementation **must** have a constructor that takes in a context.
 *
 * <p>Note that for SDK version 33 and below, this interface can be implemented by any OEM provider
 * that wishes to return credentials. The implementation must have a constructor with a context
 * parameter. A provider must :
 * <ol>
 * <li>Release a dedicated provider library that developers can add as a dependency.
 * <li>Include an empty CredentialProviderService in the provider library for the purposes of
 *   exposing a meta-data tag in the Android Manifest file.
 * <li>Add the name of the class that is implementing this interface, as a value to the meta-data
 *   tag described above.
 * <li>Make sure that there is only one provider implementation on the device. If the device already
 *   has a provider installed, and the developer specifies more than one provider dependencies,
 *   credential manager will error out.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>For SDK version 34 and above, this interface will only be implemented by an internal class
 * that will route all requests to the android framework. Providers will need to register directly
 * with the framework to provide credentials.
