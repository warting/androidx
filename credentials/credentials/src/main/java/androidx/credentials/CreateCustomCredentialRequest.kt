/**
 * Base custom create request class for registering a credential.
 *
 * An application can construct a subtype custom request and call
 * [CredentialManager.createCredential] to launch framework UI flows to collect consent and any
 * other metadata needed from the user to register a new user credential.
 *
 * If you get a [CreateCustomCredentialRequest] instead of a type-safe request class such as
 * [CreatePasswordRequest], [CreatePublicKeyCredentialRequest], etc., then you should check if you
 * have any other library at interest that supports this custom [type] of credential request, and if
 * so use its parsing utilities to resolve to a type-safe class within that library.
 *
 * Note: The Bundle keys for [credentialData] and [candidateQueryData] should not be in the form of
 * androidx.credentials.*` as they are reserved for internal use by this androidx library.
 *
 * @param type the credential type determined by the credential-type-specific subclass for custom
 *   use cases
 * @param credentialData the data of this [CreateCustomCredentialRequest] in the [Bundle] format
 *   (note: bundle keys in the form of `androidx.credentials.*` and `android.credentials.*` are
 *   reserved for internal library usage)
 * @param candidateQueryData the partial request data in the [Bundle] format that will be sent to
 *   the provider during the initial candidate query stage, which should not contain sensitive user
 *   credential information (note: bundle keys in the form of `androidx.credentials.*` and
 *   `android.credentials.*` are reserved for internal library usage)
 * @param isSystemProviderRequired true if must only be fulfilled by a system provider and false
 *   otherwise
 * @param isAutoSelectAllowed defines if a create entry will be automatically chosen if it is the
 *   only one available option, false by default
 * @param displayInfo the information to be displayed on the screen
 * @param origin the origin of a different application if the request is being made on behalf of
 *   that application (Note: for API level >=34, setting a non-null value for this parameter will
 *   throw a SecurityException if android.permission.CREDENTIAL_MANAGER_SET_ORIGIN is not present)
 * @param preferImmediatelyAvailableCredentials true if you prefer the operation to return
 *   immediately when there is no available passkey registration offering instead of falling back to
 *   discovering remote options, and false (default) otherwise
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException If [type] is empty
 * @throws NullPointerException If [type], [credentialData], or [candidateQueryData] is null
