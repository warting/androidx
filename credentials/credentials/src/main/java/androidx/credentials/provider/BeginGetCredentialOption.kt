/**
 * Base class that a credential provider receives during the query phase of a get-credential flow.
 * Classes derived from this base class contain parameters required to retrieve a specific type of
 * credential. E.g. [BeginGetPasswordOption] contains parameters required to retrieve passwords.
 *
 * [BeginGetCredentialRequest] will be composed of a list of [BeginGetCredentialOption] subclasses
 * to indicate the specific credential types and configurations that the credential provider must
 * include while building the [BeginGetCredentialResponse].
 *
 * @property id unique id representing this particular option, to be used while constructing the
 *   [CredentialEntry] to be set on [BeginGetCredentialResponse]
 * @property type the type of the credential to be retrieved against this option, e.g. a
 *   [BeginGetPasswordOption] will have type [PasswordCredential.TYPE_PASSWORD_CREDENTIAL]
 * @property candidateQueryData the parameters needed to retrieve the credentials, in the form of
 *   the raw [Bundle] - can typically be ignored by the credential provider as the required
 *   properties are already parse into the structured subclasses
 * @throws NullPointerException If [id], [type] or [candidateQueryData] is null
