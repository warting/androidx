/**
 * A [CredentialProviderService] is a service used to save and retrieve credentials for a given
 * user, upon the request of a client app that typically uses these credentials for sign-in flows.
 *
 * The credential retrieval and creation/saving is mediated by the Android System that aggregates
 * credentials from multiple credential provider services, and presents them to the user in the form
 * of a selector UI for credential selections/account selections/ confirmations etc.
 *
 * A [CredentialProviderService] is only bound to the Android System for the span of a
 * [androidx.credentials.CredentialManager] get/create API call. The service is bound only if :
 * 1. The service requires the [android.Manifest.permission.BIND_CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER_SERVICE]
 *    permission.
 * 2. The user has enabled this service as a credential provider from the settings.
 *
 * ## Basic Usage
 * The basic Credential Manager flow is as such:
 * - Client app calls one of the APIs exposed in [androidx.credentials.CredentialManager].
 * - Android system propagates the developer's request to providers that have been enabled by the
 *   user, and can support the [androidx.credentials.Credential] type specified in the request. We
 *   call this the **query phase** of provider communication. Developer may specify a different set
 *   of request parameters to be sent to the provider during this phase.
 * - In this query phase, providers, in most cases, will respond with a list of [CredentialEntry],
 *   and an optional list of [Action] entries (for the get flow), and a list of [CreateEntry] (for
 *   the create flow). No actual credentials will be returned in this phase.
 * - Provider responses are aggregated and presented to the user in the form of a selector UI.
 * - User selects an entry on the selector.
 * - Android System invokes the [PendingIntent] associated with this entry, that belongs to the
 *   corresponding provider. We call this the **final phase** of provider communication. The
 *   [PendingIntent] contains the complete request originally created by the developer.
 * - Provider finishes the [Activity] invoked by the [PendingIntent] by setting the result as the
 *   activity is finished.
 * - Android System sends back the result to the client app.
 *
 * The flow described above minimizes the amount of time a service is bound to the system. Calls to
 * the service are considered stateless. If a service wishes to maintain state between the calls, it
 * must do its own state management. Note: The service's process might be killed by the Android
 * System when unbound, for cases such as low memory on the device.
 *
 * ## Service Registration
 * In order for Credential Manager to propagate requests to a given provider service, the provider
 * must:
 * - Extend this class and implement the abstract methods.
 * - Declare the [CredentialProviderService.SERVICE_INTERFACE] intent as handled by the service.
 * - Require the [android.Manifest.permission.BIND_CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER_SERVICE] permission.
 * - Declare capabilities that the provider supports. Capabilities are essentially credential types
 *   that the provider can handle. Capabilities must be added to the metadata of the service against
 *   [CredentialProviderService.SERVICE_META_DATA].
