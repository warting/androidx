/**
 * An extension API to the [View] class that allows setting of a [PendingGetCredentialRequest], that
 * in-turn contains a [GetCredentialRequest], and a callback to deliver the final
 * [GetCredentialResponse]. The associated request is invoked when the [View] is focused/clicked by
 * the user.
 *
 * A typical scenario for setting this request is a login screen with a username & password field.
 * We recommend calling the [CredentialManager.getCredential] API when this login screen loads, so
 * that the user can be presented with a selector with all credential options to choose from. In
 * addition, we recommend using this API to set the same [GetCredentialRequest] that is passed to
 * [CredentialManager.getCredential], on the username & password views. With that, if the user
 * dismisses the initial selector, and then taps on either the username or the password field, they
 * would see the same suggestions that they saw on the selector, but now on fallback UI experiences
 * such as keyboard suggestions or drop-down lists, depending on the device capabilities.
 *
 * If you have multiple views on the screen that should invoke different requests as opposed to the
 * same, you can simply use this API to set different requests on corresponding views, and hence a
 * different set of suggestions will appear.
 *
 * Note that no errors are propagated to the [PendingGetCredentialRequest.callback]. In a scenario
 * where multiple suggestions are presented to the user as part of the keyboard suggestions for
 * instance, it is possible that the user selects one, but the flow ends up in an error state, due
 * to which the final [GetCredentialResponse] cannot be propagated. In that case, user will be taken
 * back to the suggestions, and can very well select a different suggestion which would this time
 * result in a success. The intermediate error states are not propagated to the developer, and only
 * a final response, if any, is propagated.
 *
 * @property pendingGetCredentialRequest the [GetCredentialRequest] and the associated callback to
 *   be set on the view, and to be exercised when user focused on the view in question
