/**
 * A base service for credential providers to receive advanced requests from
 * [androidx.credentials.CredentialManager].
 *
 * This service builds upon the functionality of [CredentialProviderService] by enabling support for
 * more advanced credential requests, such as conditional creation.
 *
 * Note that this service is distinct from [CredentialProviderService], which handles basic
 * credential saving and retrieval requests.
 *
 * This service is bound only during the duration of an API call. To receive requests, users must
 * enable the corresponding [CredentialProviderService] from within the same package, in Android
 * Settings.
 *
 * ## Basic Usage
 *
 * The interaction between Credential Manager and this service typically involves:
 * - A client application invokes an advanced API in [androidx.credentials.CredentialManager], such
 *   as a conditional credential creation request using
 *   [androidx.credentials.CreatePublicKeyCredentialRequest.isConditional].
 * - The Android system forwards the request to enabled credential providers that support the
 *   requested feature.
 * - Credential providers receive the request, process it, and return an appropriate response.
 * - Depending on the requested feature, providers may display UI elements such as notifications.
 * - The Android system sends the result back to the client application.
 *
 * This flow is designed to minimize the service's lifecycle. Calls to the service are stateless. If
 * a service requires maintaining state between calls, it must implement its own state management.
 * Note that the service's process may be terminated by the Android System when unbound, such as
 * during low-memory conditions.
 *
 * ## Service Registration
 *
 * To enable Credential Manager to send requests to a provider service, the provider must:
 * - Extend this class and implement the required methods.
 * - Declare the name of this service class within the metadata of the corresponding
 *   [CredentialProviderService]. This is done using the
 *   [android.service.credentials.CredentialProviderService.SERVICE_META_DATA] key. The service
 *   class name should be specified along with supported capabilities.
 *
 *   For example: ```xml <credential-provider
 *   xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" android:settingsActivity="xyz">
 *   <capabilities> <capability name="android.credentials.TYPE_PASSWORD_CREDENTIAL" /> <capability
 *   name="androidx.credentials.TYPE_PUBLIC_KEY_CREDENTIAL" /> </capabilities> <events-service
 *   class-name="MyCredentialProviderEventsService" /> </credential-provider> ```

    /**
     * Called when a credential provider should create a credential.
     *
     * This method should be extended by credential providers to receive credential creation
     * requests. Note that for now, a credential provider will only receive conditional passkey
     * creation requests through this endpoint (after certain internal conditions are met), and all
     * other regular credential creation requests will still come through
     * [CredentialProviderService.onBeginCreateCredential] API.
     *
     * The difference between [CredentialProviderService.onBeginCreateCredential] and this API is
     * that in the former, providers return entries that are shown on the UI, whereas in this one,
     * providers simply create the passkey and return the response.
     *
     * Because there is no UI from the system in the conditional passkey creation flow, it is
     * required that providers fulfill certain conditions before creating the passkey:
     * 1. Check that the user has a credential stored with the provider already that has been
     *    recently used.
     * 2. Show a notification to notify the user after creating the passkey.
     *
     * Note that the credential provider must be selected as the preferred service for them to
     * receive the conditional passkey create request. When they do receive the request, they must
     * check if the request is of type [androidx.credentials.CreatePublicKeyCredentialRequest] and
     * that [androidx.credentials.CreatePublicKeyCredentialRequest.isConditional] is set to true.
     *
     * @param request The request for creating a credential.
     * @param cancellationSignal A signal to cancel the operation.
     * @param callback The callback to receive the result of the credential creation.
