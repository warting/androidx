/**
 * A request to register digital credentials with Credential Manager.
 *
 * @param id the unique id that identifies this registry, such that it won't be overwritten by other
 *   different registries of the same `type`; in other words, registering the registry with the same
 *   id will overwrite the existing one when applicable
 * @param credentials the credentials in raw bytes
 * @param matcher the matcher wasm binary in bytes; the matcher will be interpreted and run in a
 *   safe and privacy-preserving sandbox upon an incoming request and it should output the qualified
 *   credentials given the [credentials] and the request
 * @param intentAction the intent action that will be used to launch your fulfillment activity when
 *   one of your credentials was chosen by the user, default to
 *   [RegistryManager.ACTION_GET_CREDENTIAL] when unspecified; when Credential Manager launches your
 *   fulfillment activity, it will build an intent with the given `intentAction` targeting your
 *   package, so this is useful when you need to define different fulfillment activities for
 *   different registries
