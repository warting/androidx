/**
 * Handles predictive back navigation gestures.
 *
 * This effect registers a callback to receive updates on the progress of system back gestures as a
 * [Flow] of [NavigationEvent].
 *
 * The [onEvent] lambda should be structured to handle the start, progress, completion, and
 * cancellation of the gesture:
 * ```kotlin
 * NavigationEventHandler { progress: Flow<NavigationEvent> ->
 *   // This block is executed when the back gesture begins.
 *     try {
 *       progress.collect { backEvent ->
 *         // Handle gesture progress updates here.
 *       }
 *       // This block is executed if the gesture completes successfully.
 *     } catch (e: CancellationException) {
 *       // This block is executed if the gesture is cancelled.
 *       throw e
 *     } finally {
 *       // This block is executed either the gesture is completed or cancelled.
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Precedence
 * When multiple [NavigationEventHandler] are present in the composition, the one that is composed
 * * **last** among all enabled handlers will be invoked.
 *
 * ## Usage
 * It is important to call this composable **unconditionally**. Use the `enabled` parameter to
 * control whether the handler is active. This is preferable to conditionally calling
 * [NavigationEventHandler] (e.g., inside an `if` block), as conditional calls can change the order
 * of composition, leading to unpredictable behavior where different handlers are invoked after
 * recomposition.
 *
 * ## Timing Consideration
 * There are cases where a predictive back gesture may be dispatched within a rendering frame before
 * the [enabled] flag is updated, which can cause unexpected behavior (see b/375343407,
 * b/384186542). For example, if `enabled` is set to `false`, a gesture initiated in the same frame
 * may still trigger this handler because the system sees the stale `true` value.
 *
 * @param enabled Controls whether this handler is active. **Important**: Due to the timing issue
 *   described above, a gesture starting immediately after `enabled` is set to `false` may still
 *   trigger this handler.
 * @param onEvent The lambda that receives the flow of back gesture events when a gesture begins.
 *   You **must** `collect` the flow within this lambda.
 * @see NavigationEventHandler
