/**
 * A composable that handles navigation events using simple lambda callbacks, providing contextual
 * information about both back and forward navigation destinations.
 *
 * ## Precedence
 * When multiple [NavigationEventHandler] are present in the composition, the one that is composed
 * *last* among all enabled handlers will be invoked.
 *
 * ## Usage
 * It is important to call this composable **unconditionally**. Use [isBackEnabled] and
 * [isForwardEnabled] to control whether the handler is active. This is preferable to conditionally
 * calling [NavigationEventHandler] (e.g., inside an `if` block), as conditional calls can change
 * the order of composition, leading to unpredictable behavior where different handlers are invoked
 * after recomposition.
 *
 * ## Timing Consideration
 * There are cases where a predictive back or forward gesture may be dispatched within a rendering
 * frame before the corresponding `enabled` flag is updated, which can cause unexpected behavior
 * (see b/375343407, b/384186542). For example, if [isBackEnabled] is set to `false`, a back gesture
 * initiated in the same frame may still trigger this handler because the system sees the stale
 * `true` value.
 *
 * @param T The type of the navigation information.
 * @param currentInfo An object containing information about the current destination.
 * @param backInfo A list of destinations the user may navigate back to. Can be empty if not
 *   available.
 * @param forwardInfo A list of destinations the user may navigate forward to. Can be empty if not
 *   available.
 * @param isForwardEnabled Controls whether forward navigation gestures are handled.
 * @param onForwardCancelled Called if a forward navigation gesture is cancelled.
 * @param onForwardCompleted Called when a forward navigation gesture completes and navigation
 *   occurs.
 * @param isBackEnabled Controls whether back navigation gestures are handled.
 * @param onBackCancelled Called if a back navigation gesture is cancelled.
 * @param onBackCompleted Called when a back navigation gesture completes and navigation occurs.
