/**
 * Creates a new navigation scope by providing a [NavigationEventDispatcher] to descendant
 * composables.
 *
 * This composable creates a dispatcher that links to any parent dispatcher found in the
 * composition, forming a parent-child relationship. If no parent exists, it automatically becomes a
 * new root dispatcher, this is the top-most parent in a hierarchy. This is useful for isolating
 * navigation handling within specific UI sections, such as a self-contained feature screen or tab.
 *
 * The dispatcher's lifecycle is automatically managed. It is created only once and automatically
 * disposed of when the composable leaves the composition, preventing memory leaks.
 *
 * When used to create a root dispatcher, you must use a [NavigationEventInputHandler] to send it
 * events. Otherwise, the dispatcher will be detached and will not receive events.
 *
 * @param enabled A lambda to dynamically control if the dispatcher is active. When `false`, this
 *   dispatcher and any of its children will ignore navigation events. Defaults to `true`.
 * @param parent The parent owner to link to. Defaults to the owner found in the current composition
 *   (`LocalNavigationEventDispatcherOwner`).
 * @param content The child composable content that will receive the new dispatcher.
