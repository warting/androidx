/**
 * A test implementation of [NavigationEventCallback] that records received events and invocation
 * counts.
 *
 * This class is primarily used in tests to verify that specific navigation event callbacks are
 * triggered as expected. It captures the [NavigationEvent] objects and counts how many times each
 * callback is fired.
 *
 * @param isEnabled Determines if the callback should process events. Defaults to `true`.
 * @param onEventStarted An optional lambda to execute when `onEventStarted` is called.
 * @param onEventProgressed An optional lambda to execute when `onEventProgressed` is called.
 * @param onEventCancelled An optional lambda to execute when `onEventCancelled` is called.
 * @param onEventCompleted An optional lambda to execute when `onEventCompleted` is called.
