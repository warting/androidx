/**
 * Base class for handling navigation gestures dispatched by a [NavigationEventDispatcher].
 *
 * A [NavigationEventCallback] defines how an active component responds to system navigation
 * gestures (such as predictive back) and exposes the directional context needed to represent the
 * appâ€™s current navigation affordances:
 * - [backInfo]: contextual information describing what is available when navigating back.
 * - [currentInfo]: the single active destination represented by this callback.
 * - [forwardInfo]: contextual information describing what is available when navigating forward.
 *
 * Subclasses can override lifecycle methods (e.g., `onBackStarted`, `onBackProgressed`,
 * `onBackCompleted`, `onBackCancelled`, and their forward equivalents) to respond to gesture
 * progression and terminal outcomes.
 *
 * A callback must be registered with a [NavigationEventDispatcher] to receive events. It will only
 * be invoked while both the dispatcher and this callback are enabled.
 *
 * @param isBackEnabled Whether this callback should initially handle back gestures. Defaults to
 *   `true`.
 * @param isForwardEnabled Whether this callback should initially handle forward gestures. Defaults
 *   to `true`.
 * @see NavigationEventDispatcher
 * @see NavigationEventInput

     * - This updates the local enabled state of the callback itself.
     * - More importantly, it immediately notifies the `dispatcher` (if one is attached) that its
     *   list of enabled callbacks might have changed, prompting a re-evaluation. This ensures the
     *   system's state remains consistent and responsive to changes.
