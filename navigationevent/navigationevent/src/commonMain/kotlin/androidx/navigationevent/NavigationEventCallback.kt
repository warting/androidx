     * A callback's effective enabled state is hierarchical; it is directly influenced by the
     * [NavigationEventDispatcher] it is registered with.
     *
     * **Getting the value**:
     * - This will return `false` if the associated `dispatcher` exists and its `isEnabled` state is
     *   `false`, regardless of the callback's own local setting. This provides a powerful mechanism
     *   to disable a whole group of callbacks at once by simply disabling their dispatcher.
     * - Otherwise, it returns the callback's own locally stored state.
     *
     * **Setting the value**:
     * - This updates the local enabled state of the callback itself.
     * - More importantly, it immediately notifies the `dispatcher` (if one is attached) that its
     *   list of enabled callbacks might have changed, prompting a re-evaluation. This ensures the
     *   system's state remains consistent and responsive to changes.
     *
     * For a callback to be truly active, both its local `isEnabled` property and its dispatcher's
     * `isEnabled` property must evaluate to `true`.
