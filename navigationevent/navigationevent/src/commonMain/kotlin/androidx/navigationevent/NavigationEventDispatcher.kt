/**
 * A dispatcher for navigation events that can be organized hierarchically.
 *
 * This class acts as a localized entry point for registering [NavigationEventCallback] instances
 * and dispatching navigation events within a specific UI scope, such as a composable or a fragment.
 *
 * Dispatchers can be linked in a parent-child hierarchy. This structure allows for a sophisticated
 * system where nested UI components can handle navigation events independently while still
 * respecting the state of their parent. The core logic is delegated to a single, shared
 * [NavigationEventProcessor] instance across the entire hierarchy, ensuring consistent event
 * handling.
 *
 * It is important to call [dispose] when the owner of this dispatcher is destroyed (e.g., in a
 * `DisposableEffect`) to unregister callbacks and prevent memory leaks.
