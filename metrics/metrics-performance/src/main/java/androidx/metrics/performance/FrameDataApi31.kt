/**
 * This class stores duration data for a single frame.
 *
 * This subclass of [FrameData] adds an additional value for [frameDurationCpuNanos]
 *
 * @property frameStartNanos The time at which this frame began (in nanoseconds)
 * @property frameDurationUiNanos The time spent in the UI portion of this frame (in nanoseconds).
 *   This is essentially the time spent on the UI thread to draw this frame, but does not include
 *   any time spent on the RenderThread.
 * @property frameDurationCpuNanos The time spent in the non-GPU portions of this frame (in
 *   nanoseconds). This includes the time spent on the UI thread [frameDurationUiNanos] plus time
 *   spent on the RenderThread.
 * @property frameDurationTotalNanos The total time spent rendering this frame (in nanoseconds),
 *   which includes both CPU and GPU processing.
 * @property frameOverrunNanos The amount of time past the frame deadline that this frame took to
 *   complete. A positive value indicates some jank, a negative value indicates that the frame was
 *   complete within the given deadline.
 * @property isJank Whether this frame was determined to be janky, meaning that its duration exceeds
 *   the duration determined by the system to indicate jank (@see
 *   [JankStats.jankHeuristicMultiplier]).
 * @property states The UI/app state during this frame. This is the information set by the app, or
 *   by other library code, that can be analyzed later to determine the UI state that was current
 *   when jank occurred.
 * @see JankStats.jankHeuristicMultiplier
 * @see PerformanceMetricsState.putState
