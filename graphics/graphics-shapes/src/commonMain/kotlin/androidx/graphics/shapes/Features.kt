// TODO: b/374764251 Introduce an IgnorableFeature?

/**
 * While a polygon's shape can be drawn solely using a list of [Cubic] objects representing its raw
 * curves and lines, features add an extra layer of context to groups of cubics. Features group
 * cubics into (straight) edges, convex corners, or concave corners. For example, rounding a
 * rectangle adds many cubics around its edges, but the rectangle's overall number of corners
 * remains the same. [Morph] therefore uses this grouping for several reasons:
 * - Noise Reduction: Grouping cubics reduces the amount of noise introduced by individual cubics
 *   (as seen in the rounded rectangle example).
 * - Mapping Base: The grouping serves as the base set for [Morph]'s mapping process.
 * - Curve Type Mapping: [Morph] maps similar curve types (convex, concave) together. Note that
 *   edges or features created with [buildIgnorableFeature] are ignored in the default mapping.
 *
 * By using features, you can manipulate polygon shapes with more context and control.

         *
         * Sometimes, it's helpful to ignore certain features when morphing shapes. This is because
         * only the features you mark as important will be smoothly transitioned between the start
         * and end shapes. Additionally, the default morph algorithm will try to match convex
         * corners to convex corners and concave to concave. Marking features as ignorable will
         * influence this matching. For example, given a 12-pointed star, marking all concave
         * corners as ignorable will create a [Morph] that only considers the outer corners of the
         * star. As a result, depending on the morphed to shape, the animation may have fewer
         * intersections and rotations. Another example for the other way around is a [Morph]
         * between a pointed up triangle to a square. Marking the square's top edge as a convex
         * corner matches it to the triangle's upper corner. Instead of moving triangle's upper
         * corner to one of rectangle's corners, the animation now splits the triangle to match
         * squares' outer corners.
