 * element. To do this:
 * 1) Compute the distance for all pairs of features in (features1 x features2),
 * 2) Sort ascending by by such distance
 * 3) Try to add them, from smallest distance to biggest, ensuring that: a) The features we are
 *    mapping haven't been mapped yet. b) We are not adding a crossing in the mapping. Since the
 *    mapping is sorted by the first element of each pair, this means that the second elements of
 *    each pair are monotonically increasing, except maybe one time (Counting all pair of
 *    consecutive elements, and the last element to first element).
