                    IMPACT:
                          This will significantly reduce launch application performance as every

                    SUGGESTION:
                          Many standard Jetpack and 3rd party Android libraries have embedded
                          library profiles for years. Ensure that you're using a recent enough
                          version of AGP:

                          Or if you're using a separate build system, ensure that library profiles
                          (embedded in both jars and aars) are merged, and compiled by profgen
                          (or profgen-cli).
