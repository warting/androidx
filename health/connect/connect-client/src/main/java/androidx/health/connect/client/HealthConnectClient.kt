     * resource structure, field types and presence of required fields will be performed, however
     * these checks may not cover all FHIR spec requirements and are dependant on the backing
     * implementation of Health Connect.
     *
     * Data written to Health Connect should be for a single individual only. However, the API
     * allows for multiple Patient resources to be written to account for the possibility of
     * multiple Patient resources being present in one individual's medical record.
     *
     * Each [UpsertMedicalResourceRequest] also has to meet the following requirements:
     * - [UpsertMedicalResourceRequest.data] must contain an "id" field and a "resourceType" field.
     *   The "resource type" must be one of the items in the accepted list of resource types in
     *   [FhirResource].
     * - The FHIR resource does not have a "contained" field (holds
     *   [contained resources](https://build.fhir.org/references.html#contained)).
     * - [FHIR version][UpsertMedicalResourceRequest.fhirVersion] of each request must match

     *   [MedicalDataSource]s as long as each of those [MedicalDataSource] contains at least one
     *   [MedicalResource] with the corresponding type.
     *     - For example, a client `A` created a [MedicalDataSource] `DS1`, then used `DS1` to
     *       insert a [MedicalResource] `MR1` with type
     *       [MedicalResource.MEDICAL_RESOURCE_TYPE_VACCINES]. Similarly another client `B` created
     *       `DS2`, then used `DS2` to insert another [MedicalResource] `MR2` with the same
     *       [MedicalResource.MEDICAL_RESOURCE_TYPE_VACCINES]. If `A` holds
