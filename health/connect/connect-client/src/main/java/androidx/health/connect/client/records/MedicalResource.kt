/**
 * A class to hold medical resource data.
 *
 * Unlike FHIR resource which is represented in Health Connect with [FhirResource],
 * `MedicalResource` is a Health Connect specific concept. A `MedicalResource` contains more than
 * just a [FhirResource], notably, it also contains:
 * - A [dataSourceId] representing ID of a [MedicalDataSource] where data of this `MedicalResource`
 *   come from.
 * - A [MedicalResourceType] indicating how HealthConnect categorizes the [FhirResource]. Each
 *   [MedicalResourceType] is tied to a read permission. For example, a client can only read
 *   `MedicalResource`s with [MEDICAL_RESOURCE_TYPE_VACCINES] if it holds
 *   [PERMISSION_READ_MEDICAL_DATA_VACCINES].
 *
 * The data representation follows the
 * [Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)](https://hl7.org/fhir/) standard.
 *
 * This feature is dependent on the version of HealthConnect installed on the device. To check if
 * it's available call [HealthConnectFeatures.getFeatureStatus] and pass
 * [HealthConnectFeatures.FEATURE_PERSONAL_HEALTH_RECORD] as an argument. An
 * [UnsupportedOperationException] would be thrown if the feature is not available.
 *
 * @property type The [MedicalResourceType] of this `MedicalResource`, this is assigned by Health
 *   Connect at insertion time. Clients should be aware that this list is non exhaustive and may
 *   increase in future releases when additional types will need to be handled.
 * @property id The unique ID of this `MedicalResource` represented by a [MedicalResourceId].
 * @property dataSourceId The ID of the [MedicalDataSource] where this `MedicalResource` comes from.
 * @property fhirVersion The FHIR version of [fhirResource].
 * @property fhirResource The [FhirResource] that this `MedicalResource` represents.
