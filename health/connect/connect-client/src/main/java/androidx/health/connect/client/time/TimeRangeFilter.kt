/**
 * Specification of time range for read and delete requests.
 *
 * The time range can be specified in one of the following ways:
 * - use [between] for a closed-ended time range, inclusive-exclusive;
 * - use [before] for a open-ended start time range, end time is exclusive;
 * - use [after] for a open-ended end time range, start time is inclusive.
 *
 * Time can be specified in one of the two ways:
 * - use [Instant] for a specific point in time such as "2021-01-03 at 10:00 UTC+1";
 * - use [LocalDateTime] for a user experienced time concept such as "2021-01-03 at 10 o'clock",
 *   without knowing which time zone the user was at that time. [Record] without specifying
 *   zoneOffset will assume the current system zone offset at query time.
