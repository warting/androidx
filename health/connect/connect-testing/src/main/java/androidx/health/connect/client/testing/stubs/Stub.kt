/**
 * Represents a stub mapping from a request [T] to a response [R].
 *
 * Stubs are usually created with the [stub] function or the [MutableStub] class.
 *
 * There are three possible outcomes of a stub:
 * - A value of type [R] is returned meaning that the request has succeeded and the value should be
 *   returned to the caller.
 * - An exception is thrown meaning that the request has failed and the error should be returned to
 *   the caller.
 * - Null (`null`) is returned meaning that the request has not been processed by this stub, in
 *   which case the client may call another stub or somehow fallback to a default behaviour.
 *
 * Example Stub where output depends on input:
 *
 * @sample androidx.health.connect.testing.samples.stub_mapping
 * @see stub
 * @see MutableStub
