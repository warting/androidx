/**
 * Subscribes for updates to be periodically delivered to the app.
 *
 * Data updates will be batched and delivered from the point of initial registration and will
 * continue to be delivered until the [DataType] is unregistered, either by explicitly calling
 * [clearPassiveListenerService] or by registering again without that [DataType] included in the
 * request. Higher frequency updates are available through [ExerciseClient] or [MeasureClient]. Any
 * requested goal, user activity, or health event updates will not be batched.
 *
 * Health Services will automatically bind to the provided [PassiveListenerService] to send the
 * update. Clients are responsible for defining the service in their app manifest. They should also
 * require the `com.google.android.wearable.healthservices.permission.PASSIVE_DATA_BINDING`
 * permission in their app manifest service definition in order to ensure that Health Services is
 * the source of the binding.
 *
 * This registration is unique per subscribing app. Subsequent registrations will replace the
 * previous registration, if one had been made. The client is responsible for ensuring that their
 * requested [PassiveListenerConfig] is supported on this device by checking the
 * [PassiveMonitoringCapabilities]. The returned future will fail if the request is not supported on
 * the current device or the client does not have the required permissions for the request.
 *
 * @param service the [PassiveListenerService] to bind to
 * @param config the [PassiveListenerConfig] from the client
 * @throws HealthServicesException if Health Service fails to process the call
 * @throws SecurityException if calling app does not have the required permissions
