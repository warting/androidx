 * `BaselineProfileRule` is only supported on Android 13 (API 33) and above, or if using a rooted
 * device, Android P (API 28) and above.
 *
 * Note that you can specify a `filterPredicate` to filter captured rules, for example, if you're
 * generating rules for a library, and don't want to record profiles from outside that library.

 * See the [Baseline Profile Guide](https://d.android.com/baseline-profiles) for more information on
