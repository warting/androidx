/**
 * Tracing api that writes events directly into memory.
 *
 * This has a few advantages over typical atrace:
 * - can record while atrace isn't captured either due to platform limitations (old platforms may
 *   only allow one process to be traced at a time), or when debugging benchmark performance, it can
 *   capture when atrace isn't active (e.g. tracing the start/stop of perfetto)
 * - can create events asynchronously, deferring record cost (e.g. micro creating events after all
 *   measurements, using existing timestamps)
 * - can customize presentation of events in trace
 *
 * After trace processing, the extra events (before _and_ after the measureBlock section of a
 * benchmark) can be added to the trace by calling [commitToTrace], and appending that to the trace
 * on-disk.
