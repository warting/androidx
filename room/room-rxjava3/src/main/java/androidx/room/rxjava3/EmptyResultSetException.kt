/**
 * Thrown by Room when the query in a [io.reactivex.rxjava3.core.Single] DAO method needs to return
 * a result but the returned result from the database is empty.
 *
 * Since a [io.reactivex.rxjava3.core.Single] must either emit a single non-null value or an error,
 * this exception is thrown instead of emitting a null value when the query resulted empty. If the
 * [io.reactivex.rxjava3.core.Single] contains a type argument of a collection (e.g.
 * `Single<List<Song>>`) the this exception is not thrown an an empty collection is emitted instead.
