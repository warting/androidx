/**
 * Tracks are a horizontal track of time in the trace that contains trace events - often counters
 * (`setCounter`), or slices (`beginSection` / `endSection`) - which stack together to form the
 * timeline view.
 *
 * Tracks can have parents/children, such as a [ProcessTrack] having several child [ThreadTrack]s.
 * * Use [ProcessTrack] for trace slices and events scoped to a process, but not a specific thread.
 * * Use [CounterTrack] (often created as a child of a [ProcessTrack]) to trace integer or floating
 *   point values that can be updated over time.
 * * Use [ThreadTrack] (generally created as a child of a [ProcessTrack]) to trace what is happening
 *   on a specific thread. With synchronous (non-coroutine) code, this is where most trace events
 *   should go.
