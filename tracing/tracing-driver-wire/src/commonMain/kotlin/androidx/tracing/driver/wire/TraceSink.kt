/**
 * The trace sink that writes [BufferedSink], to a new file per trace session.
 *
 * This implementation converts [TraceEvent]s into binary protos using
 * [the Wire library](https://square.github.io/wire/).
 *
 * The outputs created by `WireTraceSync` can be visualized with
 * [ui.perfetto.dev](https://ui.perfetto.dev/), and queried by
 * [TraceProcessor](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/benchmark/traceprocessor/TraceProcessor)
 * from the `androidx.benchmark:benchmark-traceprocessor` library, the
 * [C++](https://perfetto.dev/docs/analysis/trace-processor) tool it's built on, or the
 * [Python](https://perfetto.dev/docs/analysis/trace-processor-python) wrapper.
 *
 * As binary protos embed strings as UTF-8, note that any strings serialized by WireTraceSink will
 * be serialized as UTF-8.
 *
 * To create a WireTraceSink for a File, you can use `File("myFile").appendingSink().buffer()`.
