/**
 * An abstract class that allows the user to define how to merge a list of inputs to a
 * [ListenableWorker].
 *
 * Before workers run, they receive input [Data] from their parent workers, as well as anything
 * specified directly to them via [WorkRequest.Builder.setInputData]. An InputMerger takes all of
 * these objects and converts them to a single merged [Data] to be used as the worker input.
 * [WorkManager] offers two concrete InputMerger implementations: [OverwritingInputMerger] and
 * [ArrayCreatingInputMerger].
 *
 * Note that the list of inputs to merge is in an unspecified order. You should not make assumptions
 * about the order of inputs.
