import androidx.appfunctions.metadata.AppFunctionSchemaMetadata

/**
 * Marks an interface as a pre-defined schema for an App Function.
 *
 * The provided metadata will be stored in AppSearch when indexing App Functions. Agents can then
 * retrieve this metadata as an [AppFunctionSchemaMetadata] object by calling
 * [AppFunctionManagerCompat.observeAppFunctions]. Agent developers can define and share these
 * annotated App Function schemas as an SDK with app developers.
 *
 * A pre-defined schema outlines an App Function's capabilities, including its parameters and return
 * type. Knowing the schema in advance allows agents to perform tasks like model fine-tuning for
 * more accurate function calling.
 *
 * For example, here's how you might define a `findNotes` function schema:
 * ```
 * @AppFunctionSchemaDefinition(name = "findNotes", version = 1, category = "Notes")
 * interface FindNotesSchema {
 * suspend fun findNotes(
 * appFunctionContext: AppFunctionContext,
 * params: FindNotesParams,
 * ): List<Note>
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @see AppFunctionSearchSpec
