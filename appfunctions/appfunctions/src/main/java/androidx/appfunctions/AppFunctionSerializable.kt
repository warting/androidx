/**
 * Annotates a class to indicate that it can be serialized and transferred between processes using
 * AppFunction.
 *
 * When a class is annotated with `@AppFunctionSerializable` and is used as a parameter or return
 * type (directly or as a nested entity) in an AppFunction, the shape of the entity defined within
 * its primary constructor will be exposed to the caller as an
 * [androidx.appfunctions.metadata.AppFunctionMetadataDocument]. This information allows the caller
 * to construct the structured input to call an AppFunction or understand what properties are
 * provided in the structured output.
 *
 * **Constraints for Classes Annotated with `@AppFunctionSerializable`:**
 * * **Primary Constructor Parameters:** Only properties declared in the primary constructor that
 *   expose a getter method are eligible for inclusion in the AppFunctionMetadata. Critically, it is
 *   a **requirement** to place properties with a getter in primary constructor. Attempting to
 *   include constructor parameters that are not declared as properties (and thus don't have a
 *   getter) will result in a compiler error.
 * * **Supported Property Types:** The properties in the primary constructor must be of one of the
 *   following types:
 *     * `Int`
 *     * `Long`
 *     * `Float`
 *     * `Double`
 *     * `Boolean`
 *     * `String`
 *     * `IntArray`
 *     * `LongArray`
 *     * `FloatArray`
 *     * `DoubleArray`
 *     * `BooleanArray`
 *     * `List<String>`
 *     * Another class annotated with `@AppFunctionSerializable` (enabling nested structures) or a
 *       list of a class annotated with `@AppFunctionSerializable`
 * * **Public Primary Constructor:** The primary constructor of the annotated class must have public
 *   visibility to allow instantiation.
 * * **
 *
 * **IMPORTANT:** The default value set in the constructor parameter is ignored when the value is
 * missing from the function calling request. Instead, the specified rule is always used:
 * * **Non-nullable Properties:** If a value is missing for a non-nullable property from the caller,
 *   the library will throw an exception to notify the caller automatically.
 * * **Nullable Properties:** If a value is missing for a nullable property, `null` will be used.
 * * **Collection Properties:** If a value is missing for a collection property, an empty collection
 *   will be used.
 *
 * **Example:**
 *
 * ```
 * @AppFunctionSerializable
 * class Location(val latitude: Double, val longitude: Double)
 *
 * @AppFunctionSerializable
 * class Place(
 *     val name: String,
 *     val location: Location, // Nested AppFunctionSerializable
 *     // Nullable String is allowed, if missing, will be null. The default value will not be used
 *     // when the value is missing
 *     val notes: String? = "default"
 * )
 *
 * @AppFunctionSerializable
 * class SearchPlaceResult(
 *     val places: List<Place> // If missing, will be an empty list
 * )
 *
 * @AppFunctionSerializable
 * class Attachment(
 *   uri: String // Putting constructor parameter without getter will result in compiler error
 * )
 * ```
