import androidx.appfunctions.metadata.AppFunctionMetadataDocument

/**
 * Defines the specifications for filtering and searching app function snapshots.
 *
 * @constructor Creates a new instance of [AppFunctionSearchSpec].
 * @property packageNames A set of package names to filter functions by. Only functions belonging to
 *   these packages will be considered. Defaults to null, which means this field is ignored when
 *   filtering.
 *
 *   The calling app can only search metadata for functions in packages that it is allowed to query
 *   via [android.content.pm.PackageManager.canPackageQuery]. If a package is not queryable by the
 *   calling app, its functions' metadata will not be visible.
 *
 * @property schemaCategory The category of the function's schema. Defaults to null, which means
 *   this field is ignored when filtering.
 * @property schemaName The name of the function's schema. Defaults to null, which means this field
 *   is ignored when filtering.
 * @property minSchemaVersion The minimum version of the function's schema. Functions with a schema
 *   version equal to or greater than this value will be included when filtering. Defaults to 0,
 *   which means this field is ignored when filtering. This value cannot be negative.
