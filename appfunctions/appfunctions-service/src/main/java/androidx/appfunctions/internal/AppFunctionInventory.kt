/**
 * An interface providing access to metadata for a set of registered AppFunctions.
 *
 * This interface defines a contract for accessing metadata associated with AppFunctions. Each
 * AppFunction implementation class has a corresponding generated inventory class that implements
 * this interface. This inventory class provides a mapping between AppFunction IDs and their
 * respective [CompileTimeAppFunctionMetadata].
 *
 * For example, consider the following AppFunction implementation:
 * ```kotlin
 * package com.example.imageeditor
 *
 * class ImageFunctions : RotateImage, BlurImage {
 *   @AppFunction
 *   override suspend fun rotateImage(...): Image { ... }
 *
 *   @AppFunction
 *   override suspend fun blurImage(...): Image? { ... }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The generated inventory class for `ImageFunctions` would implement this interface and provide a
 * map containing metadata for both `rotateImage` and `blurImage`.
