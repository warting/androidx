package androidx.appfunctions

/**
 * Marks a function within a class as callable by other applications.
 *
 * The `@AppFunction` annotation signals that the annotated function can be invoked by external
 * applications with proper permission (e.g., an assistant). For instance, a note-taking app could
 * expose a function allowing an assistant to create notes based on user commands.
 *
 * The enclosing class of the function would be instantiated whenever an AppFunction within the
 * class is called. If the enclosing class requires constructor parameters or custom instantiation,
 * add a custom factory in [AppFunctionConfiguration.Builder.addEnclosingClassFactory]. This allows
 * you to inject dependencies or handle more complex object creation scenarios.
 *
 * When a function is annotated with `@AppFunction`, the compiler will automatically:
 * * Generate an XML file within the APK. This file describes the signatures of all
 *   `@AppFunction`-annotated functions within the application.
 * * Provide the necessary infrastructure to expose these functions via
 *   [android.app.appfunctions.AppFunctionService].
 *
 * Applications with the appropriate permissions can then use
 * [android.app.appfunctions.AppFunctionManager] to invoke these exposed functions.
 *
 * The compiler also generates an ID class associated with the class containing `@AppFunction`
 * annotations. This ID class provides constants for retrieving the unique identifier of each
 * annotated function. Consider this example:
 * ```kotlin
 * package com.example.mynotes
 *
 * class NoteFunctions: CreateNote, UpdateNote {
 *   @AppFunction
 *   override suspend fun createNote(...): Note { ... }
 *
 *   @AppFunction
 *   override suspend fun updateNote(...): Note? { ... }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The compiler will generate a `NoteFunctionsIds` class within the same `com.example.mynotes`
 * package. This generated class will contain constants like `CREATE_NOTE_ID` and `UPDATE_NOTE_ID`,
 * which correspond to the `createNote` and `updateNote` functions, respectively.
 *
 * **IMPORTANT:** By default, functions annotated with `@AppFunction` are executed on the main
 * thread. For operations that may take a significant amount of time, it is crucial to use a
 * coroutine dispatcher that runs on a background thread.
 *
 * @see AppFunctionConfiguration.Builder.addEnclosingClassFactory
