/**
 * The goal here is to get common (and correct) behavior around Activity recreation for all API
 * versions up until P, where the behavior was specified to be useful and implemented to match the
 * specification. On API 26 and 27, recreate() doesn't actually recreate the Activity if it's not in
 * the foreground; it will be recreated when the user next interacts with it. This has a few
 * undesirable consequences:
 * 1. It's impossible to recreate multiple activities at once, which means that activities in the
 *    background will observe the new configuration before they're recreated. If we keep them on the
 *    old configuration, we have two conflicting configurations active in the app, which leads to
 *    logging skew.
 * 2. Recreation occurs in the critical path of user interaction - re-inflating a bunch of views
 *    isn't free, and we'd rather do it when we're in the background than when the user is staring
 *    at the screen waiting to see us.
 *
 * On API < 26, recreate() was implemented with a single call to a private method on ActivityThread.
 * That method still exists in 26 and 27, so we can use reflection to call it and get the exact same
 * behavior as < 26. However, that behavior has problems itself. When an Activity in the background
 * is recreated, it goes through: destroy -> create -> start -> resume -> pause and doesn't stop.
 * This is a violation of the contract for onStart/onStop, but that might be palatable if it didn't
 * also have the effect of preventing new configurations from being applied - since the Activity
 * doesn't go through onStop, our tracking of whether our app is visible thinks we're always
 * visible, and thus can't do another recreation later.
 *
 * The fix for this is to add the missing onStop() call, by using reflection to call into
 * ActivityThread.
