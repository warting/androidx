 * Provide the ability for [CallsManager] to support extensions on a call.

 * management and audio routing. These optional features provide the application with the ability to
 * describe additional information about the call, which allows remote surfaces (automotive,
 * watches, etc..) to provide UX related to this additional information. Additionally, remote
 * surfaces can perform actions using a configured extension to notify this application of a remote
 * user request.

     *   Telecom is informing your VoIP application to disconnect the incoming call. Telecom is
     *   requesting this on behalf of an system service (e.g. Automotive service) or a device (e.g.
     *   Wearable).

     * @param onSetInactive Telecom is informing your VoIP application to set the call inactive.
     *   This is the same as holding a call for two endpoints but can be extended to setting a
     *   meeting inactive. Telecom is requesting this on behalf of an system service (e.g.
     *   Automotive service) or a device (e.g.Wearable). Note: Your app must stop using the
     *   microphone and playing incoming media when returning.
     * @param init The scope used to first initialize Extensions that will be used when the call is
     *   first notified to the platform and UX surfaces. Once the call is set up, the user's
     *   implementation of [ExtensionInitializationScope.onCall] will be called.
