     * This function establishes a connection with a remote service that provides meeting summary

     * provide updates via the provided callbacks:
     *

     * @param onParticipantCountChanged A suspend function that is called whenever the number of
     *   participants in the meeting changes. It receives the new participant count as an [Int],
     *   which is always 0 or greater.
     * @return A [MeetingSummaryRemote] object with an `isSupported` property of this object will
     *   indicate whether the meeting summary extension is supported by the calling application.

     * Example Usage:
     * ```kotlin
