<!--
 This XML file is a FileProvider configuration file. It defines which directories your app can
 share with other apps using FileProvider, a class within the Android support library that
 facilitates secure file sharing.
-->
<paths>
    <!--
    The files-path element in the file_paths.xml file defines a path within the app's internal
    storage that the FileProvider can use to generate ContentUris. When you write the image file
    to the directory specified by the files-path (in this case, "images/"), the FileProvider can
    still grant access to that file to other applications through a ContentUri.

    The "name" property is what the uri uses to hide the actual path.
    The "path" property is the segment that is amended to the end of the directory for a file group
    e.g.

    dir = File(context.filesDir, "images")

    dir  = [/data/user/0/androidx.core.telecom.reference/files/images]
    file = [/data/user/0/androidx.core.telecom.reference/files/images/testImage.png]
    uri  = [content://androidx.core.telecom.reference.fileprovider/my_images/testImage.png]
    -->
    <files-path
        name="my_images"
        path="images/" />
</paths>
