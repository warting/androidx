/**
 * This class manages the scroll delta between lookahead pass and approach pass. Lookahead pass is
 * the source of truth for scrolling lazy layouts. However, at times during an animation, the items
 * in approach may not be as large as they are in lookahead yet (i.e. these items have not reached
 * their target size). As such, the same scrolling that lookahead accepts may cause back scroll in
 * approach due to the smaller item size at the end of the list. In this situation, we will be
 * taking the amount of back scroll from the approach and gradually animate it down to 0 to avoid
 * any sudden jump in position via [updateScrollDeltaForApproach].
