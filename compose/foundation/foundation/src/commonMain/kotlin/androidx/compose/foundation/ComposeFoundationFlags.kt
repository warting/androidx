/**
 * This is a collection of flags which are used to guard against regressions in some of the
 * "riskier" refactors or new feature support that is added to this module. These flags are always
 * "on" in the published artifact of this module, however these flags allow end consumers of this
 * module to toggle them "off" in case this new path is causing a regression.
 *
 * These flags are considered temporary, and there should be no expectation for these flags be
 * around for an extended period of time. If you have a regression that one of these flags fixes, it
 * is strongly encouraged for you to file a bug ASAP.
 *
 * **Usage:**
 *
 * In order to turn a feature off in a debug environment, it is recommended to set this to false in
 * as close to the initial loading of the application as possible. Changing this value after compose
 * library code has already been loaded can result in undefined behavior.
 *
 *      class MyApplication : Application() {
 *          override fun onCreate() {
 *              ComposeFoundationFlags.SomeFeatureEnabled = false
 *              super.onCreate()
 *          }
 *      }
 *
 * In order to turn this off in a release environment, it is recommended to additionally utilize R8
 * rules which force a single value for the entire build artifact. This can result in the new code
 * paths being completely removed from the artifact, which can often have nontrivial positive
 * performance impact.
 *
 *      -assumevalues class androidx.compose.runtime.ComposeFoundationFlags {
 *          public static boolean SomeFeatureEnabled return false
