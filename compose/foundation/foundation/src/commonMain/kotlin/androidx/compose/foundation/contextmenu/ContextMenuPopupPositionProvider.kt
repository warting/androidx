/**
 * A [PopupPositionProvider] which places the context menu fully within the window, aligning a
 * corner of the popup menu with the cursor. For each x/y dimension it will:
 * * In cases where the window length is too small for the popup length, it aligns the start edges
 *   of the popup and the window.
 * * In cases where there is enough length between the click position and the end of the window for
 *   entire popup length, it will align the start edge of the popup with the result of the
 *   [anchorPositionBlock].
 * * In cases where there is not enough length between the click position and the end of the window
 *   for entire popup length, but there is between the click position and the start of the window,
 *   it will align the end edge of the popup with the result of the [anchorPositionBlock].
 * * In the final case: the window length is wide enough for the popup, but there isn't enough
 *   length on either side of the result of the [anchorPositionBlock] to fit an edge of the popup
 *   with the resulting position. It will align the end edges of the popup and window.
 *
 * @param anchorPositionBlock A function that provides the [IntOffset] to align to. This should be
 *   in the same coordinates that the [Popup] is anchored to. In the case of a right-click context
 *   menu, this would be the position of the right-click.
 * @param onPositionCalculated A snapshot-aware callback that is invoked after the position is
 *   calculated. It provides the result of the [anchorPositionBlock] in its first parameter and the
 *   bounds of the resulting popup in its second parameter. Changes to state read during this lambda
 *   will result in the popup re-calculating its position. This callback is useful for situations
 *   where you need to vary your popup based on the resulting position of the popup.
