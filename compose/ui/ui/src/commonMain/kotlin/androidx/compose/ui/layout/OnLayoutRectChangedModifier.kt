/**
 * Invokes [callback] with the position of this layout node relative to the coordinate system of the
 * root of the composition, as well as in screen coordinates and window coordinates. This will be
 * called after layout pass. This API allows for throttling and debouncing parameters in order to
 * moderate the frequency with which the callback gets invoked during high rates of change (e.g.
 * scrolling).
 *
 * Specifying [throttleMillis] will prevent [callback] from being executed more than once over that
 * time period. Specifying [debounceMillis] will delay the execution of [callback] until that amount
 * of time has elapsed without a new position, scheduling the callback to be executed when that
 * amount of time expires.
 *
 * Specifying 0 for both [throttleMillis] and [debounceMillis] will result in the callback being
 * executed every time the position has changed. Specifying non-zero amounts for both will result in
 * both conditions being met. Specifying a non-zero [throttleMillis] but a zero [debounceMillis] is
 * equivalent to providing the same value for both [throttleMillis] and [debounceMillis].
 *
 * @param throttleMillis The duration, in milliseconds, to prevent [callback] from being executed
 *   more than once over that time period.
 * @param debounceMillis The duration, in milliseconds, to delay the execution of [callback] until
 *   that amount of time has elapsed without a new position.
