 * Configuration toggle to map testTags to resource-id.
 *
 * This provides a way of filling in AccessibilityNodeInfo.viewIdResourceName, which in the View
 * System is populated based on the resource string in the XML.
 *
 * testTags are also provided in AccessibilityNodeInfo.extras under key
 * "androidx.compose.ui.semantics.testTag". However, when using UIAutomator or on Android 7 and
 * below, extras are not available, so a more backwards-compatible way of making testTags available
 * to accessibility-tree-based integration tests is sometimes needed. resource-id was the most
 * natural property to repurpose for this.
 *
 * This property applies to a semantics subtree. For example, if it's set to true on the root
 * semantics node of the app (and no child nodes set it back to false), then every testTag will be
 * mapped.

/*
 * Semantics that maps directly to the [android.view.accessibility.AccessibilityNodeInfo.className].
 * Accessibility services will use this to describe the element or do customizations.
 *
 * Developers will rarely set it directly. In most cases the [android.view.accessibility.AccessibilityNodeInfo.className] is derived from other semantics automatically. This property can be useful for niche use cases where deriving the classname is
 * not possible or a special customisation is required.
 *
 * Note that when you assign this semantics, it will override a AccessibilityNodeInfo's classname
 * that would otherwise be determined automatically through the presence of other semantics properties.
 *
 * The value of this property is not an arbitrary string. It should correspond to the type or a
 * constant defined on Android platform. For example, to assign a button classname you would use
 * "android.widget.Button".
