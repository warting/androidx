/**
 * Manages a top-level input session, as created by [Owner.textInputSession].
 *
 * On Android there are three levels of input sessions:
 * 1. [PlatformTextInputModifierNode.establishTextInputSession]: The app is performing some
 *    initialization before requesting the keyboard.
 * 2. [PlatformTextInputSession.startInputMethod]: The app has requested the keyboard with a
 *    particular implementation for [View.onCreateInputConnection] represented by a
 *    [PlatformTextInputMethodRequest].
 * 3. [View.onCreateInputConnection]: The system has responded to the keyboard request by asking the
 *    view for a new [InputConnection].
 *
 * Each of these sessions is a parent of the next, in terms of lifetime and cancellation.
 *
 * This class manages child sessions started by [startInputMethod]. Each child session is
 * represented by an [InputMethodSession], which in turn coordinates between multiple calls to
 * [createInputConnection] for a single session.
