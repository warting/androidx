/**
 * The receiver scope of the key input injection lambda from [performKeyInput].
 *
 * All sequences and patterns of key input can be expressed using the two fundamental methods of
 * this API - [keyDown] and [keyUp]. All other injection functions are provided as abstractions
 * built on top of these two methods in order to improve test code readability/maintainability and
 * decrease development time.
 *
 * The entire event injection state is shared between all `perform.*Input` methods, meaning you can
 * continue an unfinished key input sequence in a subsequent invocation of [performKeyInput] or
 * [performMultiModalInput].
 *
 * All events sent by these methods are batched together and sent as a whole after [performKeyInput]
 * has executed its code block.
 *
 * When a key is held down - i.e. the virtual clock is forwarded whilst the key is pressed down,
 * repeat key down events will be sent. In a fashion consistent with Android's implementation, the
 * first repeat key event will be sent after a key has been held down for 500ms. Subsequent repeat
 * events will be sent at 50ms intervals, until the key is released or another key is pressed down.
 *
 * The sending of repeat key events is handled as an implicit side-effect of [advanceEventTime],
 * which is called within the injection scope. As such, no repeat key events will be sent if
 * [MainTestClock.advanceTimeBy] is used to advance the time.
