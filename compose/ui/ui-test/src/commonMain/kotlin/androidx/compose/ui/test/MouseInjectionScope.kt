/**
 * The receiver scope of the mouse input injection lambda from [performMouseInput].
 *
 * The functions in [MouseInjectionScope] can roughly be divided into two groups: full gestures and
 * individual mouse events. The individual mouse events are: [press], [moveTo] and friends,
 * [release], [cancel], [scroll] and [advanceEventTime]. Full gestures are all the other functions,
 * like [MouseInjectionScope.click], [MouseInjectionScope.doubleClick],
 * [MouseInjectionScope.animateMoveTo], etc. These are built on top of the individual events and
 * serve as a good example on how you can build your own full gesture functions.
 *
 * A mouse move event can be sent with [moveTo] and [moveBy]. The mouse position can be updated with
 * [updatePointerTo] and [updatePointerBy], which will not send an event and only update the
 * position internally. This can be useful if you want to send an event that is not a move event
 * with a location other then the current location, but without sending a preceding move event. Use
 * [press] and [release] to send button pressed and button released events. This will also send all
 * other necessary events that keep the stream of mouse events consistent with actual mouse input,
 * such as a hover exit event. A [cancel] event can be sent at any time when at least one button is
 * pressed. Use [scroll] to send a mouse scroll event.
 *
 * The entire event injection state is shared between all `perform.*Input` methods, meaning you can
 * continue an unfinished mouse gesture in a subsequent invocation of [performMouseInput] or
 * [performMultiModalInput]. Note however that while the mouse's position is retained across
 * invocation of `perform.*Input` methods, it is always manipulated in the current node's local
 * coordinate system. That means that two subsequent invocations of [performMouseInput] on different
 * nodes will report a different [currentPosition], even though it is actually the same position on
 * the screen.
 *
 * All events sent by these methods are batched together and sent as a whole after
 * [performMouseInput] has executed its code block.
 *
 * Example of performing a mouse click:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.ui.test.samples.mouseInputClick
 *
 * Example of scrolling the mouse wheel while the mouse button is pressed:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.ui.test.samples.mouseInputScrollWhileDown
