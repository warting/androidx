 * Use [atLeastOneRootRequired] to treat not finding any compose hierarchies at all as an error. If

 * set [atLeastOneRootRequired] to `false` and no error will be thrown if there are no compose
 * roots, and the wait for compose roots will be reduced to .5 seconds.
 *
 * This method will wait for quiescence before collecting all SemanticsNodes. Collection happens on
 * the main thread and the [transform]ation of all SemanticsNodes to a result is done while on the
 * main thread. This allows us to transform the result using methods that must be called on the main
 * thread, without switching back and forth between the main thread and the test thread.
