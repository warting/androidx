/**
 * Adds a named assertion to the collection of assertions to be executed before test actions.
 *
 * This API is intended to be invoked by assertion frameworks to register assertions that must hold
 * on the entire application whenever it's fully loaded and ready to interact with. They will be
 * invoked upon common actions such as `performClick`, and they always verify every element on the
 * screen, not just the element the action is performed on.
 *
 * This is particularly useful to automatically catch accessibility problems such as contrast ratio,
 * minimum touch-target size, etc.
 *
 * @param name An identifier for the assertion. It can subsequently be used to deactivate the
 *   assertion with [removeGlobalAssertion].
 * @param assertion A function to be executed.
