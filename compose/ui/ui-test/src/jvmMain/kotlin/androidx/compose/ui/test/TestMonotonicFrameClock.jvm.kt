 * A [MonotonicFrameClock] with a time source controlled by a `kotlinx-coroutines-test`
 * [TestCoroutineScheduler]. This frame clock may be used to consistently drive time under
 * controlled tests.
 *
 * Calls to [withFrameNanos] will schedule an upcoming frame [frameDelayNanos] nanoseconds in the
 * future by launching into [coroutineScope] if such a frame has not yet been scheduled. The current
 * frame time for [withFrameNanos] is provided by [delayController]. It is strongly suggested that
 * [coroutineScope] contain the test dispatcher controlled by [delayController].
 *
 * @param coroutineScope The [CoroutineScope] used to simulate the main thread and schedule frames
 *   on. It must contain a [TestCoroutineScheduler] and a [ContinuationInterceptor].
 * @param frameDelayNanos The number of nanoseconds to [delay] between executing frames.
 * @param onPerformTraversals Called with the frame time of the frame that was just executed, after
 *   running all `withFrameNanos` callbacks, but before resuming their callers' continuations. Any
 *   continuations resumed while running frame callbacks or [onPerformTraversals] will not be
 *   dispatched until after [onPerformTraversals] finishes. If [onPerformTraversals] throws, all
 *   `withFrameNanos` callers will be cancelled.
