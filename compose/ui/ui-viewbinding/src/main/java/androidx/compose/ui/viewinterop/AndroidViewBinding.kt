/**
 * Composes an Android layout resource in the presence of [ViewBinding]. The binding is obtained
 * from the [factory] block, which will be called exactly once to obtain the [ViewBinding] to be
 * composed, and it is also guaranteed to be invoked on the UI thread. Therefore, in addition to
 * creating the [ViewBinding], the block can also be used to perform one-off initializations and
 * [View] constant properties' setting. The [update] block can be run multiple times (on the UI
 * thread as well) due to recomposition, and it is the right place to set [View] properties
 * depending on state. When state changes, the block will be reexecuted to set the new properties.
 * Note the block will also be ran once right after the [factory] block completes.
 *
 * This overload of [AndroidViewBinding] does not automatically pool or reuse Views and their
 * bindings. If placed inside of a reusable container (including inside a
 * [LazyRow][androidx.compose.foundation.lazy.LazyRow] or
 * [LazyColumn][androidx.compose.foundation.lazy.LazyColumn]), the View instances and their bindings
 * will always be discarded and recreated if the composition hierarchy containing the
 * `AndroidViewBinding` changes, even if its group structure did not change and the `View` and its
 * binding could have conceivably been reused.
 *
 * To opt-in for View reuse, call the overload of [AndroidViewBinding] that accepts an `onReset`
 * callback, and provide a non-null implementation for this callback. Since it is expensive to
 * discard and recreate View instances, reusing Views can lead to noticeable performance
 * improvements — especially when building a scrolling list of [AndroidViews][AndroidView]. It is
 * highly recommended to opt-in to View reuse when possible.
 *
 * There is generally no need to opt-in for reuse when using an `AndroidViewBinding` to host a
 * Fragment, since Fragments have their own view lifecycles and do not usually appear in contexts
 * where the reuse offered by `AndroidViewBinding` would lead to measurable performance
 * improvements.
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.ui.samples.AndroidViewBindingSample
 * @param factory The block creating the [ViewBinding] to be composed.
 * @param modifier The modifier to be applied to the layout.

 *
 * This overload includes support for View reuse, which behaves in the same way as it does for
 * [AndroidView]. Namely, Views and their binding instances are only eligible for reuse if a
 * non-null [onReset] callback is provided. It is expensive to discard and recreate View instances,
 * so opting-in to View reuse can lead to noticeable performance improvements — especially when
 * [AndroidViewBinding] is used in a scrolling list. It is highly recommended to specify an
 * [onReset] implementation and opt-in to View reuse when possible.
 *
 * When [onReset] is specified, [View] instances and their bindings may be reused when hosted inside
 * of a container that supports reusable elements. Reuse occurs when compatible instances of
 * [AndroidViewBinding] are inserted and removed during recomposition. Two instances of
 * `AndroidViewBinding` are considered compatible if they are invoked with the same composable group
 * structure. The most common scenario where this happens is in lazy layout APIs like `LazyRow` and
 * `LazyColumn`, which can reuse layout nodes (and, in this case, Views and their bindings as well)
 * between items when scrolling.
 *
 * [onReset] is invoked on the UI thread when the View and its binding will be reused, signaling
 * that the View and binding should be prepared to appear in a new context in the composition
 * hierarchy. This callback is invoked before [update] and may be used to reset any transient View
 * state like animations or user input.
 *
 * Note that [onReset] may not be immediately followed by a call to [update]. Compose may
 * temporarily detach the View from the composition hierarchy if it is deactivated but not released
 * from composition. This can happen if the View appears in a [ReusableContentHost] that is not
 * currently active or inside of a [movable content][androidx.compose.runtime.movableContentOf]
 * block that is being moved. If this happens, the View will be removed from its parent, but
 * retained by Compose so that it may be reused if its content host becomes active again. If the
 * View never becomes active again and is instead discarded entirely, the [onReset] callback will be
 * invoked directly from this deactivated state when Compose releases the View and its binding.
 *
 * When the View is removed from the composition permanently, [onRelease] will be invoked (also on
 * the UI thread). Once this callback returns, Compose will never attempt to reuse the previous View
 * or binding instance regardless of whether an [onReset] implementation was provided. If the View
 * is needed again in the future, a new instance will be created, with a fresh lifecycle that begins
 * by calling the [factory].
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.ui.samples.AndroidViewBindingReusableSample
 * @param factory The block creating the [ViewBinding] to be composed.
 * @param modifier The modifier to be applied to the layout.
 * @param onReset A callback invoked as a signal that the view is about to be attached to the
 *   composition hierarchy in a different context than its original creation. This callback is
 *   invoked before [update] and should prepare the view for general reuse. If `null` or not
 *   specified, the `AndroidViewBinding` instance will not support reuse, and the View and its
 *   binding will always be discarded whenever the AndroidViewBinding is moved or removed from the
 *   composition hierarchy.
 * @param onRelease A callback invoked as a signal that this view and its binding have exited the
 *   composition hierarchy entirely and will not be reused again. Any additional resources used by
 *   the binding should be freed at this time.
 * @param update The callback to be invoked after the layout is inflated and upon recomposition to
 *   update the information and state of the binding.
