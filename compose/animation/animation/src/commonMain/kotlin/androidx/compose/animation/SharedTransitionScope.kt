     * defined by the exiting shared element to the target bounds calculated based on the incoming
     * shared element. The animation for the bounds can be customized using [boundsTransform].
     * During the bounds transform, [sharedElement] will re-measure and relayout its child layout
     * using fixed constraints derived from its animated size, similar to [RemeasureToBounds]
     * resizeMode in [sharedBounds].
     *
     * In contrast to [sharedBounds], [sharedElement] is designed for shared content that has the
     * exact match in terms of visual content and layout when the measure constraints are the same.
     * Such examples include image assets, icons,
     * [MovableContent][androidx.compose.runtime.MovableContent] etc. Only the shared element that
     * is becoming visible will be rendered during the transition. The bounds for shared element are
     * determined by the bounds of the shared element becoming visible based on the target state of
     * [animatedVisibilityScope].
     *
     * **Important**: When a shared element finds its match and starts a transition, it will be
     * rendered into the overlay of the [SharedTransitionScope] in order to avoid being faded in/out
     * along with its parents or clipped by its parent as it transforms to the target size and

     * applied _explicitly_ as the child of [sharedElement] (i.e. after [sharedElement] modifier in
     * the modifier chain). For example: `Modifier.sharedElement(...).clip(shape =
     * RoundedCornerShape(20.dp)).animateEnterExit(...)`
     *
     * By default, the [sharedElement] is clipped by the [clipInOverlayDuringTransition] of its
     * parent [sharedBounds]. If the [sharedElement] has no parent [sharedBounds] or if the parent
     * [sharedBounds] has no clipping defined, it'll not be clipped. If additional clipping is
     * desired to ensure [sharedElement] doesn't move outside of a visual bounds,
     * [clipInOverlayDuringTransition] can be used to specify the clipping for when the shared
     * element is going through an active transition towards a new target bounds.
     *
     * While the shared elements are rendered in overlay during the transition, its
     * [zIndexInOverlay] can be specified to allow shared elements to render in a different order
     * than their placement/zOrder when not in the overlay. For example, the title of a page is
     * typically placed and rendered before the content below. During the transition, it may be
     * desired to animate the title over on top of the other shared elements on that page to
     * indicate significance or a point of interest. [zIndexInOverlay] can be used to facilitate
     * such use cases. [zIndexInOverlay] is 0f by default.
     *
     * [renderInOverlayDuringTransition] is true by default. In some rare use cases, there may be no
     * clipping or layer transform (fade, scale, etc) in the application that prevents shared
     * elements from transitioning from one bounds to another without any clipping or sudden alpha
     * change. In such cases, [renderInOverlayDuringTransition] could be specified to false.
     *
     * During a shared element transition, the space that was occupied by the exiting shared element
     * and the space that the entering shared element will take up are considered place holders.
     * Their sizes during the shared element transition can be configured through [placeHolderSize].
     * By default, it will be the same as the content size of the respective shared element. It can
     * also be set to [animatedSize] or any other [PlaceHolderSize] to report to their parent layout

    /**
     * [sharedBoundsWithCallerManagedVisibility] is a modifier that tags a layout with a
     * [SharedContentState.key], such that entering and exiting shared bounds of the same key share
     * the animated and continuously changing bounds during the layout change. The bounds will be
     * animated from the initial bounds defined by the exiting shared bounds to the target bounds
     * calculated based on the incoming shared bounds. The animation for the bounds can be
     * customized using [boundsTransform].
     *
     * Compared to [sharedBounds], [sharedBoundsWithCallerManagedVisibility] is designed for shared
     * bounds transitions where the shared bounds is not a part of the content that is being
     * animated out by [AnimatedVisibility]. Therefore, it is the caller's responsibility to
     * explicitly remove the exiting shared bounds (i.e. shared bounds where [visible] == false)
     * from the tree as appropriate. Typically this is when the transition is finished (i.e.
     * [SharedTransitionScope.isTransitionActive] == false). The target bounds is derived from the
     * [sharedBoundsWithCallerManagedVisibility] with [visible] being true.
     *
     * Similar to [sharedBounds], [sharedBoundsWithCallerManagedVisibility] is designed for shared
     * content that has the visually different content. It keeps the continuity of the bounds.
     * Unlike [sharedBounds], [sharedBoundsWithCallerManagedVisibility] will not apply any enter
     * transition or exit transition for the incoming and outgoing content within the bounds. Such
     * enter and exit animation will need to be added by the caller of this API.
     *
     * **Important**: When a shared bounds finds its match and starts a transition, it will be
     * rendered into the overlay of the [SharedTransitionScope] in order to avoid being faded in/out
     * along with its parents or clipped by its parent as it transforms to the target size and
     * position. This also means that any clipping or fading for the shared elements will need to be
     * applied _explicitly_ as the child of [sharedBoundsWithCallerManagedVisibility] (i.e. after
     * [sharedBoundsWithCallerManagedVisibility] modifier in the modifier chain). For example:
     * ```
     * Modifier.sharedBoundsWithCallerManagedVisibility(...)
     *         .clip(shape = RoundedCornerShape(20.dp))
     * ```
     *
     * By default, the [sharedBoundsWithCallerManagedVisibility] is clipped by the
     * [clipInOverlayDuringTransition] of its parent [sharedBounds]. If the
     * [sharedBoundsWithCallerManagedVisibility] has no parent [sharedBounds] or if the parent
     * [sharedBounds] has no clipping defined, it'll not be clipped. If additional clipping is
     * desired to ensure [sharedBoundsWithCallerManagedVisibility] doesn't move outside of a visual
     * bounds, [clipInOverlayDuringTransition] can be used to specify the clipping for when the
     * shared bounds is going through an active transition towards a new target bounds.
     *
     * While the shared bounds are rendered in overlay during the transition, its [zIndexInOverlay]
     * can be specified to allow shared bounds to render in a different order than their
     * placement/zOrder when not in the overlay. For example, the title of a page is typically
     * placed and rendered before other layouts. During the transition, it may be desired to animate
     * the title over on top of the other shared elements on that page to indicate significance or a
     * point of interest. [zIndexInOverlay] can be used to facilitate such use cases.
     * [zIndexInOverlay] is 0f by default.
     *
     * [renderInOverlayDuringTransition] is true by default. In some rare use cases, there may be no
     * clipping or layer transform (fade, scale, etc) in the application that prevents shared bounds
     * from transitioning from one bounds to another without any clipping or sudden alpha change. In
     * such cases, [renderInOverlayDuringTransition] could be specified to false.
     *
     * During a shared bounds transition, the space that was occupied by the exiting shared bounds
     * and the space that the entering shared bounds will take up are considered place holders.
     * Their sizes during the shared bounds transition can be configured through [placeHolderSize].
     * By default, it will be the same as the content size of the respective shared bounds. It can
     * also be set to [animatedSize] or any other [PlaceHolderSize] to report to their parent layout
     * an animated size to create a visual effect where the parent layout dynamically adjusts the
     * layout to accommodate the animated size of the shared bounds.
