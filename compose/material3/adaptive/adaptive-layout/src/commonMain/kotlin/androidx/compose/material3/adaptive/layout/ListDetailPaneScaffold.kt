/**
 * A three pane layout that follows the Material guidelines, displaying the provided panes in a
 * canonical
 * [list-detail layout](https://m3.material.io/foundations/layout/canonical-layouts/list-detail).
 *
 * This overload takes a [ThreePaneScaffoldValue] describing the adapted value of each pane within
 * the scaffold.
 *
 * Here's a basic usage sample, which demonstrates how a layout can change from single pane to dual
 * pane under different window configurations:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.material3.adaptive.samples.ListDetailPaneScaffoldSample
 *
 * For a more sophisticated sample that supports an extra pane and pane expansion functionality that
 * allows users to drag to change layout split, see:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.material3.adaptive.samples.ListDetailPaneScaffoldSampleWithExtraPane
 *
 * By default there isn't a drag handle rendered so users aren't able to drag to change the pane
 * split. Providing a drag handle like the above sample shows will enable the functionality. We
 * suggest developers to use the vertical drag handle implementation provided by the Material3
 * component library here to have default theming/styling support. You can integrate the component
 * as the following sample shows:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.material3.adaptive.samples.PaneExpansionDragHandleSample
 *
 * Note that if there's no drag handle, you can still modify [paneExpansionState] directly to apply
 * pane expansion.
 *
 * The following code gives a sample of how to integrate with the Compose Navigation library:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.material3.adaptive.samples.NavigableListDetailPaneScaffoldSample
 * @param directive The top-level directives about how the scaffold should arrange its panes.
 * @param value The current adapted value of the scaffold, which indicates how each pane of the
 *   scaffold is adapted.
 * @param listPane the list pane of the scaffold, which is supposed to hold a list of item summaries
 *   that can be selected from, for example, the inbox mail list of a mail app. See
 *   [ListDetailPaneScaffoldRole.List]. Note that we suggest you to use [AnimatedPane] as the root
 *   layout of panes, which supports default pane behaviors like enter/exit transitions.
 * @param detailPane the detail pane of the scaffold, which is supposed to hold the detailed info of
 *   a selected item, for example, the mail content currently being viewed. See
 *   [ListDetailPaneScaffoldRole.Detail]. Note that we suggest you to use [AnimatedPane] as the root
 *   layout of panes, which supports default pane behaviors like enter/exit transitions.
 * @param modifier [Modifier] of the scaffold layout.
 * @param extraPane the extra pane of the scaffold, which is supposed to hold any supplementary info
 *   besides the list and the detail panes, for example, a task list or a mini-calendar view of a
 *   mail app. See [ListDetailPaneScaffoldRole.Extra]. Note that we suggest you to use
 *   [AnimatedPane] as the root layout of panes, which supports default pane behaviors like
 *   enter/exit transitions.
 * @param paneExpansionDragHandle the pane expansion drag handle to allow users to drag to change
 *   pane expansion state, `null` by default.
 * @param paneExpansionState the state object of pane expansion; when no value is provided but
 *   [paneExpansionDragHandle] is not `null`, a default implementation will be created for the drag
 *   handle to use.
