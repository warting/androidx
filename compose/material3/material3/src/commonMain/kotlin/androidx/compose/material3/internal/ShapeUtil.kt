 * happening (to the nearest thousandth), to work around rendering artifacts introduced by some
 * points being just slightly off from each other (far less than a pixel). This also allows for a
 * more optimal path, as redundant curves (usually a single point) can be detected and not added to
 * the resulting path.
 *
 * @param path a [Path] object which, if supplied, will avoid the function having to create a new
 *   [Path] object
 * @param startAngle an angle (in degrees) to rotate the [Path] to start drawing from. The rotation
 *   pivot is set to be the polygon's centerX and centerY coordinates.
 * @param repeatPath whether or not to repeat the [Path] twice before closing it. This flag is
 *   useful when the caller would like to draw parts of the path while offsetting the start and stop
 *   positions (for example, when phasing and rotating a path to simulate a motion as a Star
 *   circular progress indicator advances).
 * @param closePath whether or not to close the created [Path]
