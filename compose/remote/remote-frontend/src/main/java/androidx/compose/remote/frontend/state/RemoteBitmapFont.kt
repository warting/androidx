/**
 * Represents a **bitmap font** within a Compose Remote hierarchy.
 *
 * A bitmap font defines its glyphs (character representations) using individual [Bitmap] images.
 * This class allows you to define custom fonts using rasterized images for each character or
 * character sequence.
 *
 * When bitmap fonts are rendered, a **greedy algorithm** is used to match parts of the text to
 * available glyphs. This means that the system prefers to match longer glyphs (e.g., a glyph for
 * "fi") over shorter ones (e.g., individual glyphs for 'f' and 'i') if both are available.
 *
 * @property glyphs A [List] of [Glyph] objects that define the character mappings and visual
 *   properties for this font. The maximum length of the glyphs list is 65535.
 * @property kerningTable The kerning table, where the key is pairs of glyphs (literally $1$2) and
 *   the value is the horizontal adjustment in pixels for that glyph pair. Can be empty. The maximum
 *   size of the kerning table is 65535 entries.
