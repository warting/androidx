/**
 * Allows to execute a normal composable within RemoteCompose, and only capturing the resulting draw
 * instructions (any layout code would execute during the draw, but wouldn't be captured).
 *
 * Essentially, it's like taking a screenshot of the passed composable, capturing what it display as
 * draw commands, but once recorded in the document the composable will not be run again, and not
 * able to react to things (eg user input, animations, etc.).
 *
 * This is useful as a tool to capture composables that are of fixed dimensions and not updated at
 * runtime.
