/**
 * The Watch Face Push API allows a Wear OS app to install a watch face on a watch programmatically.
 * The watch faces will then be available in the watch carousel similarly to watch faces that are
 * downloaded from Play Store. **It's important to note that all functions in this API operate only
 * on watch faces that have been added by the calling application.** Watch faces added by other apps
 * or pre-existing on the device cannot be managed using this API.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * <code>lateinit var wf1: android.os.ParcelFileDescriptor
 *   val token1 = "1234" // Get it from the provided validation library.
 *   lateinit var wf2: android.os.ParcelFileDescriptor
 *   val token2 = "4567"
 *   val wfp = WatchFacePushManagerFactory.createWatchFacePushManager(context)
 *   with(wfp) {
 *     val slot = addWatchFace(wf1, token1)
 *     setWatchFaceAsActive(slot.slotId)
 *     updateWatchFace(slot.slotId, wf2, token2)
 *     removeWatchFace(slot.slotId)
 *   }</code>
