/**
 * Material surfaces can be displayed in different shapes. Shapes direct attention, identify
 * components, communicate state, and express brand.
 *
 * The shape scale defines the style of container, offering a range of curved shapes. The default
 * [Shapes] theme for Material3 is rounded rectangles, with various degrees of corner roundness:
 * - None
 * - Extra Small
 * - Small
 * - Medium
 * - Large
 * - Extra Large
 * - Full
 *
 * You can customize the shape of any component by overriding the shape parameter for that
 * component. For example, by default, buttons use the shape style "large". If your product requires
 * a smaller amount of roundness, you can override the shape parameter with a different shape value
 * like [Shapes.small].
