/**
 * Create a new [AmbientLifecycleObserver] for use on a real device.
 *
 * Applications which wish to show layouts in ambient mode should attach the returned observer to
 * their activities or fragments, passing in a set of callback to be notified about ambient state.
 * In addition, the app needs to declare that it uses the [android.Manifest.permission.WAKE_LOCK]
 * permission in its manifest.
 *
 * The created [AmbientLifecycleObserver] can also be used to query whether the device is in ambient
 * mode.
 *
 * As an example of how to use this class, see the following example:
 * ```
 * class MyActivity : ComponentActivity() {
 *     private val callbacks = object : AmbientLifecycleObserver.AmbientLifecycleCallback {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 *
 *     private val ambientObserver = AmbientLifecycleObserver(this, mainExecutor, callbacks)
 *
 *     override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle) {
 *         super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
 *         lifecycle.addObserver(ambientObserver)
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * If the observer is registered while the device is in ambient mode, the registered callback will
 * immediately receive a call to [AmbientLifecycleObserver.AmbientLifecycleCallback.onEnterAmbient].
 * If the device is in active mode, the callbacks will be registered, and `onEnterAmbient` will be
 * called when the device next enters ambient mode.
 *
 * @param activity The activity that this observer is being attached to.
 * @param callbackExecutor The executor to run the provided callbacks on.
 * @param callbacks An instance of [AmbientLifecycleObserver.AmbientLifecycleCallback], used to
 *   notify the observer about changes to the ambient state.
