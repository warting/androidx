/**
 * [AppScaffold] is one of the Wear Material3 scaffold components.
 *
 * The scaffold components [AppScaffold] and [ScreenScaffold] lay out the structure of a screen and
 * coordinate transitions of the [ScrollIndicator] and [TimeText] components.
 *
 * [AppScaffold] allows static screen elements such as [TimeText] to remain visible during in-app
 * transitions such as swipe-to-dismiss. It provides a slot for the main application content, which
 * will usually be supplied by a navigation component such as SwipeDismissableNavHost.
 *
 * Example of using AppScaffold and ScreenScaffold:
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material3.samples.ScaffoldSample
 * @param modifier The modifier for the top level of the scaffold.
 * @param timeText The default time (and potentially status message) to display at the top middle of
 *   the screen in this app. When [AppScaffold] is used in combination with [ScreenScaffold], the
 *   time text will be scrolled away and shown/hidden according to the scroll state of the screen.
 * @param containerColor The container color of the app drawn behind the [content], i.e. the color
 *   of the background behind the content.
 * @param contentColor The content color for the application [content].
 * @param content The main content for this application.
