/**
 * [ScreenScaffold] is one of the Wear Material3 scaffold components.
 *
 * The scaffold components [AppScaffold] and [ScreenScaffold] lay out the structure of a screen and
 * coordinate transitions of the [ScrollIndicator] and [TimeText] components. [AppScaffold] should
 * be at the top of the composition (because it provides [ScaffoldState] and layers [TimeText] on
 * top of all other content) and [ScreenScaffold] should be part of [AppScaffold]'s content. When
 * used in conjunction with SwipeDismissableNavHost, [AppScaffold] remains at the top of the
 * composition, whilst [ScreenScaffold] will be placed for each individual composable route.
 *
 * [ScreenScaffold] displays the [ScrollIndicator] at the center-end of the screen by default and
 * coordinates showing/hiding [TimeText] and [ScrollIndicator] according to [scrollState].
 *
 * This version of [ScreenScaffold] has a special slot for a button at the bottom, that grows and
 * shrinks to take the available space after the scrollable content.
 *
 * Example of using AppScaffold and ScreenScaffold with ScalingLazyColumn:
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material3.samples.ScaffoldWithSLCEdgeButtonSample
 *
 * Example of using AppScaffold and ScreenScaffold with TransformingLazyColumn:
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material3.samples.ScaffoldWithTLCEdgeButtonSample
 * @param scrollState The scroll state for [ScalingLazyColumn], used to drive screen transitions
 *   such as [TimeText] scroll away and showing/hiding [ScrollIndicator].
 * @param edgeButton Slot for an [EdgeButton] that takes the available space below a scrolling list.
 *   It will scale up and fade in when the user scrolls to the end of the list, and scale down and
 *   fade out as the user scrolls up.
 * @param modifier The modifier for the screen scaffold.
 * @param contentPadding The padding to apply around the entire content. This contentPadding is then
 *   received by the [content] and should be consumed by using [Modifier.padding] or contentPadding
 *   parameter of the lazy lists. The bottom padding value is always ignored because we instead use
 *   [edgeButtonSpacing] to specify the gap between edge button and content - and the [EdgeButton]
 *   hugs the bottom of the screen.
 * @param timeText Time text (both time and potentially status message) for this screen, if
 *   different to the time text at the [AppScaffold] level. When null, the time text from the
 *   [AppScaffold] is displayed for this screen.
 * @param scrollIndicator The [ScrollIndicator] to display on this screen, which is expected to be
 *   aligned to Center-End. It is recommended to use the Material3 [ScrollIndicator] which is
 *   provided by default. No scroll indicator is displayed if null is passed.
 * @param edgeButtonSpacing The space between [EdgeButton] and the list content
 * @param overscrollEffect the [OverscrollEffect] that will be used to render overscroll for this
 *   layout. This overscroll effect will be shared with all components within this ScreenScaffold
 *   such as [edgeButton] and [scrollIndicator] through [LocalOverscrollFactory]. If necessary, this
 *   behaviour can be disabled by passing overscrollEffect = null.
 * @param content The body content for this screen. The lambda receives a [PaddingValues] that
 *   should be applied to the content root via [Modifier.padding] or contentPadding parameter when
 *   used with lists to properly offset the [EdgeButton].

/**
 * [ScreenScaffold] is one of the Wear Material3 scaffold components.
 *
 * The scaffold components [AppScaffold] and [ScreenScaffold] lay out the structure of a screen and
 * coordinate transitions of the [ScrollIndicator] and [TimeText] components. [AppScaffold] should
 * be at the top of the composition (because it provides [ScaffoldState] and layers [TimeText] on
 * top of all other content) and [ScreenScaffold] should be part of [AppScaffold]'s content. When
 * used in conjunction with SwipeDismissableNavHost, [AppScaffold] remains at the top of the
 * composition, whilst [ScreenScaffold] will be placed for each individual composable route.
 *
 * [ScreenScaffold] displays the [ScrollIndicator] at the center-end of the screen by default and
 * coordinates showing/hiding [TimeText], [ScrollIndicator] and the bottom button according to a
 * [scrollInfoProvider].
 *
 * This version of [ScreenScaffold] has a special slot for a button at the bottom, that grows and
 * shrinks to take the available space after the scrollable content. In this overload, both
 * edgeButton and scrollInfoProvider must be specified.
 *
 * Example of using AppScaffold and ScreenScaffold with ScalingLazyColumn:
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material3.samples.ScaffoldWithSLCEdgeButtonSample
 *
 * Example of using AppScaffold and ScreenScaffold with TransformingLazyColumn:
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material3.samples.ScaffoldWithTLCEdgeButtonSample
 * @param scrollInfoProvider Provider for scroll information used to scroll away screen elements
 *   such as [TimeText] and coordinate showing/hiding the [ScrollIndicator], this needs to be a
 *   [ScrollInfoProvider].
 * @param edgeButton slot for a [EdgeButton] that takes the available space below a scrolling list.
 *   It will scale up and fade in when the user scrolls to the end of the list, and scale down and
 *   fade out as the user scrolls up.
 * @param modifier The modifier for the screen scaffold.
 * @param contentPadding The padding to apply around the entire content. This contentPadding is then
 *   received by the [content] and should be consumed by using [Modifier.padding] or contentPadding
 *   parameter of the lazy lists. The bottom padding value is always ignored because we instead use
 *   [edgeButtonSpacing] to specify the gap between edge button and content - and the [EdgeButton]
 *   hugs the bottom of the screen.
 * @param timeText Time text (both time and potentially status message) for this screen, if
 *   different to the time text at the [AppScaffold] level. When null, the time text from the
 *   [AppScaffold] is displayed for this screen.
 * @param scrollIndicator The [ScrollIndicator] to display on this screen, which is expected to be
 *   aligned to Center-End. It is recommended to use the Material3 [ScrollIndicator] which is
 *   provided by default. No scroll indicator is displayed if null is passed.
 * @param edgeButtonSpacing The space between [EdgeButton] and the list content. This gap size could
 *   not be smaller then [ScreenScaffoldDefaults.EdgeButtonMinSpacing].
 * @param overscrollEffect the [OverscrollEffect] that will be used to render overscroll for this
 *   layout. This overscroll effect will be shared with all components within this ScreenScaffold
 *   such as [edgeButton] and [scrollIndicator] through [LocalOverscrollFactory]. If necessary, this
 *   behaviour can be disabled by passing overscrollEffect = null.
 * @param content The body content for this screen. The lambda receives a [PaddingValues] that
 *   should be applied to the content root via [Modifier.padding] or contentPadding parameter when
 *   used with lists to properly offset the [EdgeButton].
