/**
 * [SwipeToReveal] Material composable. This adds the option to configure up to two additional
 * actions on a Composable: a mandatory [SwipeToRevealScope.primaryAction] and an optional
 * [SwipeToRevealScope.secondaryAction]. These actions are initially hidden and revealed only when
 * the [content] is swiped. These additional actions can be triggered by clicking on them after they
 * are revealed. [SwipeToRevealScope.primaryAction] will be triggered on full swipe of the
 * [content].
 *
 * For actions like "Delete", consider adding [SwipeToRevealScope.undoPrimaryAction] (displayed when
 * the [SwipeToRevealScope.primaryAction] is activated). Adding undo composables allow users to undo
 * the action that they just performed.
 *
 * [SwipeToReveal] composable adds the [CustomAccessibilityAction]s using the labels from primary
 * and secondary actions.
 *
 * Example of [SwipeToReveal] with primary and secondary actions
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material3.samples.SwipeToRevealSample
 *
 * Example of [SwipeToReveal] with a Card composable, it reveals a taller button.
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material3.samples.SwipeToRevealSingleActionCardSample
 *
 * Example of [SwipeToReveal] that doesn't reveal the actions, instead it only executes them when
 * fully swiped or bounces back to its initial state.
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material3.samples.SwipeToRevealNonAnchoredSample
 *
 * Example of [SwipeToReveal] with a [TransformingLazyColumn]
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material3.samples.SwipeToRevealWithTransformingLazyColumnSample
 * @param actions Actions of the [SwipeToReveal] composable, such as
 *   [SwipeToRevealScope.primaryAction]. [actions] should always include exactly one
 *   [SwipeToRevealScope.primaryAction]. [SwipeToRevealScope.secondaryAction],
 *   [SwipeToRevealScope.undoPrimaryAction] and [SwipeToRevealScope.undoSecondaryAction] are
 *   optional.
 * @param modifier [Modifier] to be applied on the composable
 * @param revealState [RevealState] of the [SwipeToReveal]
 * @param actionButtonHeight Desired height of the revealed action buttons. In case the content is a
 *   Button composable, it's suggested to use [SwipeToRevealDefaults.SmallActionButtonHeight], and
 *   for a Card composable, it's suggested to use [SwipeToRevealDefaults.LargeActionButtonHeight].
 * @param gestureInclusion Provides fine-grained control so that touch gestures can be excluded when
 *   they start in a certain region. An instance of [GestureInclusion] can be passed in here which
 *   will determine via [GestureInclusion.ignoreGestureStart] whether the gesture should proceed or
 *   not. By default, [gestureInclusion] allows gestures everywhere for when [revealState] contains
 *   anchors for both directions (see [bidirectionalGestureInclusion]). If it doesn't, then it
 *   allows gestures everywhere, except a zone on the left edge, which is used for swipe-to-dismiss
 *   (see [gestureInclusion]).
 * @param content The content that will be initially displayed over the other actions provided.
 * @see [androidx.wear.compose.foundation.SwipeToReveal]
