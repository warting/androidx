/**
 * Object to be used to apply different transformation to the content and the container (i.e. the
 * background) of the composable.
 *
 * This interface allows you to customize the appearance of a surface by modifying the container
 * painter and applying visual transformations to the content. In this context, a surface is a
 * container composable that displays content (which could use other Composables such as Icon, Text
 * or Button) as well as a background typically drawn using a painter. This is useful for creating
 * custom effects like scaling, rotation, or applying shaders.
 *
 * Example usage with the [Button]:
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material3.samples.SurfaceTransformationButtonSample
 *
 * Example usage with the [Card]:
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material3.samples.SurfaceTransformationCardSample
 *
 * Example of adding support in a custom component:
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material3.samples.SurfaceTransformationOnCustomComponent
