 * application developers to show information about different parts of their application.
 *
 * This AppCard does not handle input events - see the other AppCard overloads if you want a
 * clickable AppCard.
 *
 * The first row of the layout has three slots, 1) a small optional application [Image] or [Icon] of
 * size [CardDefaults.AppImageSize]x[CardDefaults.AppImageSize] dp, 2) an application name
 * (emphasised with the [CardColors.appColor()] color), it is expected to be a short start aligned
 * [Text] composable, and 3) the time that the application activity has occurred which will be shown
 * on the top row of the card, this is expected to be an end aligned [Text] composable showing a
 * time relevant to the contents of the [Card].
 *
 * The second row shows a title, this is expected to be a single row of start aligned [Text].
 *
 * The rest of the [Card] contains the content which can be either [Text] or an [Image]. If the
 * content is text it can be single or multiple line and is expected to be Top and Start aligned.
 *
