/**
 * Base level Wear Material3 [Button] that offers a single slot to take any content. Used as the
 * container for more opinionated [Button] components that take specific content such as icons and
 * labels.
 *
 * The [Button] is stadium-shaped by default and its standard height is designed to take 2 lines of
 * text of [Typography.labelMedium] style. With localisation and/or large font sizes, the text can
 * extend to a maximum of 3 lines in which case, the [Button] height adjusts to accommodate the
 * contents.
 *
 * [Button] takes the [ButtonDefaults.buttonColors] color scheme by default, with colored
 * background, contrasting content color and no border. This is a high-emphasis button for the
 * primary, most important or most common action on a screen.
 *
 * Other recommended buttons with [ButtonColors] for different levels of emphasis are:
 * [FilledTonalButton] which defaults to [ButtonDefaults.filledTonalButtonColors], [OutlinedButton]
 * which defaults to [ButtonDefaults.outlinedButtonColors] and [ChildButton] which defaults to
 * [ButtonDefaults.childButtonColors]. For a background image, see [ImageButton].
 *
 * Button can be enabled or disabled. A disabled button will not respond to click events.
 *
 * Example of a [Button]:
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material3.samples.SimpleButtonSample
 * @param onClick Will be called when the user clicks the button
 * @param modifier Modifier to be applied to the button
 * @param onLongClick Called when this button is long clicked (long-pressed). When this callback is
 *   set, [onLongClickLabel] should be set as well.
 * @param onLongClickLabel Semantic / accessibility label for the [onLongClick] action.
 * @param enabled Controls the enabled state of the button. When `false`, this button will not be
 *   clickable
 * @param shape Defines the button's shape. It is strongly recommended to use the default as this
 *   shape is a key characteristic of the Wear Material3 Theme
 * @param colors [ButtonColors] that will be used to resolve the background and content color for
 *   this button in different states. See [ButtonDefaults.buttonColors].
 * @param border Optional [BorderStroke] that will be used to resolve the border for this button in
 *   different states.
 * @param contentPadding The spacing values to apply internally between the container and the
 *   content
 * @param interactionSource an optional hoisted [MutableInteractionSource] for observing and
 *   emitting [Interaction]s for this button. You can use this to change the button's appearance or
 *   preview the button in different states. Note that if `null` is provided, interactions will
 *   still happen internally.
 * @param transformation Transformation to be used when button appears inside a container that needs
 *   to dynamically change its content separately from the background.
 * @param content Slot for composable body content displayed on the Button

 *
 * The [FilledTonalButton] is stadium-shaped by default and its standard height is designed to take
 * 2 lines of text of [Typography.labelMedium] style - either a two-line label or both a single line
 * label and a secondary label. With localisation and/or large font sizes, the [FilledTonalButton]
 * height adjusts to accommodate the contents. The label and secondary label should be consistently
 * aligned.
 *
 * If a icon is provided then the labels should be "start" aligned, e.g. left aligned in ltr so that
 * the text starts next to the icon.
 *
 * If a icon is provided then the labels should be "start" aligned, e.g. left aligned in ltr so that

 *
 * [FilledTonalButton] takes the [ButtonDefaults.filledTonalButtonColors] color scheme by default,
 * with muted background, contrasting content color and no border. This is a medium-emphasis button
 * for important actions that don't distract from other onscreen elements, such as final or
 * unblocking actions in a flow with less emphasis than [Button].
 *
 * Other recommended buttons with [ButtonColors] for different levels of emphasis are: [Button]
 * which defaults to [ButtonDefaults.buttonColors], [OutlinedButton] which defaults to
 * [ButtonDefaults.outlinedButtonColors] and [ChildButton] which defaults to
 * [ButtonDefaults.childButtonColors]. For a background image, see [ImageButton].
 *
 * [FilledTonalButton] can be enabled or disabled. A disabled button will not respond to click
 * events.
 *
 * Example of a [FilledTonalButton] with an icon and secondary label:
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material3.samples.FilledTonalButtonSample
 * @param onClick Will be called when the user clicks the button
 * @param modifier Modifier to be applied to the button
 * @param onLongClick Called when this button is long clicked (long-pressed). When this callback is
 *   set, [onLongClickLabel] should be set as well.
 * @param onLongClickLabel Semantic / accessibility label for the [onLongClick] action.
 * @param secondaryLabel A slot for providing the button's secondary label. The contents are
 *   expected to be text which is "start" aligned if there is an icon preset and "start" or "center"
 *   aligned if not. label and secondaryLabel contents should be consistently aligned.
 * @param icon A slot for providing the button's icon. The contents are expected to be a
 *   horizontally and vertically aligned icon of size [ButtonDefaults.IconSize] or
 *   [ButtonDefaults.LargeIconSize].
 * @param enabled Controls the enabled state of the button. When `false`, this button will not be
 *   clickable
 * @param shape Defines the button's shape. It is strongly recommended to use the default as this
 *   shape is a key characteristic of the Wear Material3 Theme
 * @param colors [ButtonColors] that will be used to resolve the background and content color for
 *   this button in different states. See [ButtonDefaults.filledTonalButtonColors].

/**
 * A Wear Material3 [CompactButton] that offers two slots and a specific layout for an icon and
 * label. Both the icon and label are optional however it is expected that at least one will be
 * provided.
 *
 * The [CompactButton] is Stadium shaped and has a max height designed to take no more than one line
 * of text and/or one icon. The default max height is [ButtonDefaults.CompactButtonHeight]. This
 * includes a visible button height of 32.dp and 8.dp of padding above and below the button in order
 * to meet accessibility guidelines that request a minimum of 48.dp height and width of tappable
 * area.
 *
 * If an icon is provided then the labels should be "start" aligned, e.g. left aligned in
 * left-to-right mode so that the text starts next to the icon.
 *
 * The items are laid out as follows.
 * 1. If a label is provided then the button will be laid out with the optional icon at the start of
 *    a row followed by the label with a default max height of [ButtonDefaults.CompactButtonHeight].
 * 2. If only an icon is provided it will be laid out vertically and horizontally centered with a
 *    default height of [ButtonDefaults.CompactButtonHeight] and the default width of
 *    [ButtonDefaults.IconOnlyCompactButtonWidth]
 *
 * If neither icon nor label is provided then the button will displayed like an icon only button but
 * with no contents or background color.
 *
 * [CompactButton] takes the [ButtonDefaults.buttonColors] color scheme by default, with colored
 * background, contrasting content color and no border. This is a high-emphasis button for the
 * primary, most important or most common action on a screen.
 *
 * Other recommended [ButtonColors] for different levels of emphasis are:
 * [ButtonDefaults.filledTonalButtonColors], [ButtonDefaults.outlinedButtonColors] and
 * [ButtonDefaults.childButtonColors]. Buttons can also take an image background using
 * [ButtonDefaults.imageButtonColors].
 *
 * [CompactButton] can be enabled or disabled. A disabled button will not respond to click events.
 *
 * Example of a [CompactButton] with an icon and a label
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material3.samples.CompactButtonSample
 *
 * Example of a [CompactButton] with an icon and label and with
 * [ButtonDefaults.filledTonalButtonColors]
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material3.samples.FilledTonalCompactButtonSample
 *
 * Example of a [CompactButton] with an icon and label and with
 * [ButtonDefaults.outlinedButtonBorder] and [ButtonDefaults.outlinedButtonColors]. The example
 * includes a [Text] that expands and collapses when the [CompactButton] is clicked.
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material3.samples.OutlinedCompactButtonSample
 *
 * Example of a [CompactButton] with onLongClick:
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material3.samples.CompactButtonWithOnLongClickSample
 * @param onClick Will be called when the user clicks the button
 * @param modifier Modifier to be applied to the button
 * @param onLongClick Called when this button is long clicked (long-pressed). When this callback is
 *   set, [onLongClickLabel] should be set as well.
 * @param onLongClickLabel Semantic / accessibility label for the [onLongClick] action.
 * @param icon A slot for providing the button's icon. The contents are expected to be a
 *   horizontally and vertically aligned icon of size [ButtonDefaults.ExtraSmallIconSize] when used
 *   with a label or [ButtonDefaults.SmallIconSize] when used as the only content in the button.
 * @param enabled Controls the enabled state of the button. When `false`, this button will not be
 *   clickable.
 * @param shape Defines the button's shape. It is strongly recommended to use the default as this
 *   shape is a key characteristic of the Wear Material3 Theme
 * @param colors [ButtonColors] that will be used to resolve the background and content color for
 *   this button in different states. See [ButtonDefaults.buttonColors].
 * @param border Optional [BorderStroke] that will be used to resolve the border for this button in
 *   different states.
 * @param contentPadding The spacing values to apply internally between the container and the
 *   content
 * @param interactionSource an optional hoisted [MutableInteractionSource] for observing and
 *   emitting [Interaction]s for this button. You can use this to change the button's appearance or
 *   preview the button in different states. Note that if `null` is provided, interactions will
 *   still happen internally.
 * @param transformation Transformation to be used when button appears inside a container that needs
 *   to dynamically change its content separately from the background.
 * @param label A slot for providing the button's main label. The contents are expected to be a
 *   single line of text which is "start" aligned if there is an icon preset and "center" aligned if
 *   not.
