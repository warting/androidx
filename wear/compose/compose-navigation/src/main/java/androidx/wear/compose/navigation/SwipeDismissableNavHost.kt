/**
 * Provides a place in the Compose hierarchy for self-contained navigation to occur, with backwards
 * navigation provided by a swipe gesture.
 *
 * Once this is called, any Composable within the given [NavGraphBuilder] can be navigated to from
 * the provided [navController].
 *
 * The builder passed into this method is [remember]ed. This means that for this NavHost, the
 * contents of the builder cannot be changed.
 *
 * During a swipe-to-dismiss gesture, the previous navigation level (if any) is shown in the
 * background. BackgroundScrimColor and ContentScrimColor of it are taken from
 * [LocalSwipeToDismissBackgroundScrimColor] and [LocalSwipeToDismissContentScrimColor].
 *
 * Below API level 35, content of the current navigation level is displayed within a
 * [BasicSwipeToDismissBox] to detect swipe back gestures.
 *
 * API level 35 onwards, [SwipeDismissableNavHost] listens to platform predictive back events for
 * navigation, and [BasicSwipeToDismissBox] is not used for swipe gesture detection.
 *
 * Example of a [SwipeDismissableNavHost] alternating between 2 screens:
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.navigation.samples.SimpleNavHost
 *
 * Example of a [SwipeDismissableNavHost] for which a destination has a named argument:
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.navigation.samples.NavHostWithNamedArgument
 * @param navController The navController for this host
 * @param startDestination The route for the start destination
 * @param modifier The modifier to be applied to the layout
 * @param userSwipeEnabled [Boolean] Whether swipe-to-dismiss gesture is enabled.
 * @param state State containing information about ongoing swipe and animation. This parameter is
 *   unused API level 35 onwards, because the platform supports predictive back and
 *   [SwipeDismissableNavHost] uses platform gestures to detect the back gestures.
 * @param route The route for the graph
 * @param builder The builder used to construct the graph
