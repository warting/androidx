/**
 * Scaffold implements the basic Wear Material Design visual layout structure.
 *
 * This component provides API to put together several material components to construct your screen,
 * by ensuring proper layout strategy for them and collecting necessary data so these components
 * will work together correctly.
 *
 * The Scaffold provides the main application structure in a Wear Material application. It provides
 * slots for the different parts of the application and sensible defaults were appropriate.
 *
 * The layout of the Wear Scaffold is typically z-layered with decorations such as
 * [PositionIndicator], [HorizontalPageIndicator] and [Vignette] applied in the order laid out in
 * the Wear Material Design guidance.
 *
 * Simple example of a Scaffold with a [ScalingLazyColumn] as the main application content and a
 * scroll indicator to show the position of the items in the ScalingLazyColumn as.
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.material.samples.SimpleScaffoldWithScrollIndicator
 * @param modifier optional Modifier for the root of the [Scaffold]
 * @param vignette a full screen slot for applying a vignette over the contents of the scaffold. The
 *   vignette is used to blur the screen edges when the main content is scrollable content that
 *   extends beyond the screen edge.
 * @param positionIndicator slot for optional position indicator used to display information about
 *   the position of the Scaffold's contents. Usually a [PositionIndicator]. Common use cases for
 *   the position indicator are scroll indication for a list or rsb/bezel indication such as volume.
 * @param pageIndicator slot for optional page indicator used to display information about the
 *   selected page of the Scaffold's contents. Usually a [HorizontalPageIndicator]. Common use case
 *   for the page indicator is a pager with horizontally swipeable pages.
 * @param timeText time and potential application status message to display at the top middle of the
 *   screen. Expected to be a TimeText component.
 * @param content Slot for composable screen content
