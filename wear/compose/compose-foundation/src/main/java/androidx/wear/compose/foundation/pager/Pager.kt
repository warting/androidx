 * A horizontally scrolling Pager optimized for Wear OS devices. This component wraps the standard

 * performance, usability, and adherence to Wear OS design guidelines.
 *
 * Please refer to the samples to learn how to use this API.
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.foundation.samples.SimpleHorizontalPagerSample
 * @param state The state to control this pager
 * @param modifier A modifier instance to be applied to this Pager outer layout
 * @param contentPadding a padding around the whole content. This will add padding for the content
 *   after it has been clipped, which is not possible via [modifier] param. You can use it to add a
 *   padding before the first page or after the last one.
 * @param beyondViewportPageCount Pages to compose and layout before and after the list of visible
 *   pages. Note: Be aware that using a large value for [beyondViewportPageCount] will cause a lot
 *   of pages to be composed, measured and placed which will defeat the purpose of using lazy
 *   loading. This should be used as an optimization to pre-load a couple of pages before and after
 *   the visible ones. This does not include the pages automatically composed and laid out by the
 *   pre-fetcher in the direction of the scroll during scroll events.
 * @param flingBehavior The [TargetedFlingBehavior] to be used for post scroll gestures.
 * @param userScrollEnabled whether the scrolling via the user gestures or accessibility actions is
 *   allowed. You can still scroll programmatically using [PagerState.scroll] even when it is
 *   disabled.
 * @param gestureInclusion When userScrollEnabled=true, this function provides more fine-grained
 *   control so that touch gestures can be excluded when they start in a certain region. An instance
 *   of [GestureInclusion] can be passed in here which will determine via
 *   [GestureInclusion.ignoreGestureStart] whether the gesture should proceed or not. By default,
 *   [gestureInclusion] allows gestures everywhere except a zone on the left edge of the first page,
 *   which is used for swipe-to-dismiss (see [PagerDefaults.gestureInclusion]).
 * @param reverseLayout reverse the direction of scrolling and layout.
 * @param key a stable and unique key representing the item. When you specify the key the scroll
 *   position will be maintained based on the key, which means if you add/remove items before the
 *   current visible item the item with the given key will be kept as the first visible one. If null
 *   is passed the position in the list will represent the key.
 * @param rotaryScrollableBehavior Parameter for changing rotary behavior. By default rotary support
 *   is disabled for [HorizontalPager]. It can be enabled by passing
 *   [RotaryScrollableDefaults.snapBehavior] with pagerState parameter.
 * @param content A composable function that defines the content of each page displayed by the
 *   Pager. This is where the UI elements that should appear within each page should be placed.
