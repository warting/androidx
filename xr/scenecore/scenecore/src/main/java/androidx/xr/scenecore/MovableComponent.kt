/**
 * This [Component] can be attached to a single instance of an [Entity]. When attached, this
 * Component will enable the user to translate the Entity by pointing and dragging on it.
 *
 * Creating this Component with [MovableComponent.createCustomMovable] will create the Component but
 * not move the attached Entity. It requires an [EntityMoveListener] which will provide suggested
 * Poses from the system that an application can use to move the attached Entity. This should be
 * used if the application wants to add custom logic for the Entity's movement.
 * [MovableComponent.createSystemMovable] will create the Component and move the attached Entity
 * when the user drags it to a position recommended by the system.
 * [MovableComponent.createAnchorable] will create the Component, move the attached Entity when the
 * user drags it, and also potentially reparent the Entity to a new [AnchorEntity]. This will occur
 * if the user lets go of the Entity near a perception plane that matches the settings in the
 * provided [AnchorPlacement].
 *
 * This component cannot be attached to an [AnchorEntity] or to the [ActivitySpace]. Calling
 * [Entity.addComponent] to an Entity with these types will return false.
 *
 * NOTE: This Component is currently unsupported on [GltfModelEntity].
