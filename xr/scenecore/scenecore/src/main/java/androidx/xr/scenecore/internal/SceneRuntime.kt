/**

 * This interface is responsible for the logical structure of the XR experience, managing the
 * hierarchy of entities, their transformations, and their behaviors. It provides the core
 * functionalities for spatial computing, such as world tracking, plane detection, and anchoring
 * objects to the physical environment. It also handles user interaction components and spatial
 * audio.
 *
 * This API is intended for internal use only and is not a public API.
