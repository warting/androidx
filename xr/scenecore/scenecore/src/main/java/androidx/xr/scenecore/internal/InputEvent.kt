/**
 * Defines input events for SceneCore.
 *
 * @param source Type of source (e.g. hands, controller, head) that generated this event.
 * @param pointerType Type of the individual pointer (e.g. left, right or default) for this event.
 * @param timestamp Timestamp from
 *   [SystemClock.uptimeMillis](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/SystemClock#uptimeMillis())
 *   time base.
 * @param origin The origin of the ray in the receiver's activity space.
 * @param direction A point indicating the direction the ray is pointing, in the receiver's activity
 *   space.
 * @param action Actions similar to Android's
 *   [MotionEvent](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/MotionEvent) for keeping
 *   track of a sequence of events on the same target, e.g., HOVER_ENTER -> HOVER_MOVE ->
 *   HOVER_EXIT, DOWN -> MOVE -> UP.
 * @param hitInfoList List of [HitInfo] for the scene entities from the same task that were hit by
 *   the input ray, if any. The list is sorted from closest to farthest from the ray origin. Note
 *   that this first hit entity remains the same during an ongoing DOWN -> MOVE -> UP action, even
 *   if the pointer stops hitting the entity during the action.
