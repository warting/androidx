/**
 * The SpatialEnvironment is used to manage the XR background and passthrough. There is a single
 * instance of this class managed by each SceneCore Session (which is bound to an [Activity].)
 *
 * The SpatialEnvironment is a composite of a stand-alone skybox, and glTF-specified geometry. A
 * single skybox and a single glTF can be set at the same time. Applications are encouraged to
 * supply glTFs for ground and horizon visibility.
 *
 * The XR background can be set to display one of three configurations:
 * 1) A combination of a skybox and glTF geometry.
 * 2) A Passthrough surface, where the XR background is a live feed from the device's outward facing
 *    cameras. At full opacity, this surface completely occludes the skybox and geometry.
 * 3) A mixed configuration where the passthrough surface is not at full opacity nor is it at zero
 *    opacity. The passthrough surface becomes semi-transparent and alpha blends with the skybox and
 *    geometry behind it.
 *
 * Note that methods in this class do not necessarily take effect immediately. Rather, they set a
 * preference that will be applied when the device enters a state where the XR background can be
 * changed.
