/**
 * SurfaceEntity is a concrete implementation of Entity that hosts a StereoSurface Canvas. The
 * entity creates and owns an Android Surface into which the application can render stereo image
 * content. This Surface is then texture mapped to the canvas, and if a stereoscopic StereoMode is
 * specified, then the User will see left and right eye content mapped to the appropriate display.
 *
 * Note that it is not currently possible to synchronize CanvasShape and StereoMode changes with
 * application rendering or video decoding. Applications are advised to carefully hide this entity
 * around transitions to manage glitchiness.
 *
 * @property canvasShape The [CanvasShape] which describes the mesh to which the Surface is mapped.
 * @property stereoMode The [StereoMode] which describes how parts of the surface are displayed to
 *   the user's eyes.
 * @property dimensions The dimensions of the canvas in the local spatial coordinate system of the
 *   entity.
 * @property alphaMaskTexture The texture to be composited into the alpha channel of the surface. If
 *   null, the alpha mask will be disabled.
 * @property auxiliaryAlphaMaskTexture The texture to be composited into the alpha channel of the
 *   secondary view of the surface. This is only used for interleaved stereo content. If null, the
 *   alpha mask will be disabled.
 * @property featherRadiusX a [Float] which controls the canvas-relative radius of the edge fadeout
 *   on the left and right edges of the SurfaceEntity canvas.
 * @property featherRadiusY a [Float] which controls the canvas-relative radius of the edge fadeout
 *   on the top and bottom edges of the SurfaceEntity canvas.
