 *
 * We define horizontal accuracy as the radius of the 68th percentile confidence level around the
 * estimated horizontal location. In other words, if you draw a circle centered at this
 * GeospatialPose's latitude and longitude, and with a radius equal to the horizontal accuracy, then
 * there is a 68% probability that the true location is inside the circle. Larger numbers indicate
 * lower accuracy.
 *
 * For example, if the latitude is 10°, longitude is 10°, and the returned value is 15, then there
 * is a 68% probability that the true location is within 15 meters of the (10°, 10°)
 * latitude/longitude coordinate.
 *
 * We define vertical accuracy as the radius of the 68th percentile confidence level around the
 * estimated altitude. In other words, there is a 68% probability that the true altitude is within
 * the output value (in meters) of this GeospatialPose's altitude (above or below). Larger numbers
 * indicate lower accuracy.
 *
 * For example, if this GeospatialPose's altitude is 100 meters, and the output value is 20 meters,
 * there is a 68% chance that the true altitude is within 20 meters of 100 meters.
 *
 * Yaw rotation is the angle between the pose's compass direction and north, and can be determined
 * from [eastUpSouthQuaternion].
 *
 * We define yaw accuracy as the estimated radius of the 68th percentile confidence level around yaw
 * angles from [eastUpSouthQuaternion]. In other words, there is a 68% probability that the true yaw
 * angle is within [orientationYawAccuracy] of this GeospatialPose's orientation. Larger values
 * indicate lower accuracy.
 *
 * For example, if the estimated yaw angle is 60°, and the orientation yaw accuracy is 10°, then
 * there is an estimated 68% probability of the true yaw angle being between 50° and 70°.
 *
 * @property pose the [GeospatialPose] that was created.
 * @property horizontalAccuracy the estimated horizontal accuracy in meters with respect to latitude
 *   and longitude.
 * @property verticalAccuracy the estimated altitude accuracy in meters.
 * @property orientationYawAccuracy the estimated orientation yaw angle accuracy.
