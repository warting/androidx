/**
 * Asynchronously creates a new [Anchor] at a specified horizontal position and altitude relative to
 * the horizontal position's surface (Terrain or Rooftop).
 *
 * The specified [altitudeAboveSurface] is interpreted to be relative to the given surface at the
 * specified latitude/longitude geospatial coordinates, rather than relative to the WGS84 ellipsoid.
 * Specifying an altitude of 0 will position the anchor directly on the surface whereas specifying a
 * positive altitude will position the anchor above the surface, against the direction of gravity.
 *
 * [Surface.TERRAIN] refers to the Earth's terrain (or floor) and [Surface.ROOFTOP] refers to the
 * top of a building at the given horizontal location. If there is no building at the given
 * location, then the rooftop surface is interpreted to be the terrain instead.
 *
 * You may resolve multiple anchors at a time, but a session cannot be tracking more than 100
 * surface anchors at time. Attempting to resolve more than 100 surface anchors will return an
 * [AnchorCreateResourcesExhausted] result.
 *
 * Creating a Terrain anchor requires an active Earth which is [State.RUNNING]. If it is not, then
 * this function returns an [AnchorCreateIllegalState] result. This call also requires a working
 * internet connection to communicate with the ARCore API on Google Cloud. ARCore will continue to
 * retry if it is unable to establish a connection to the ARCore service.
 *
 * A Terrain anchor's tracking state will be [TrackingState.PAUSED] if the Earth is not actively
 * tracking. Its tracking state will permanently become [TrackingState.STOPPED] if
 * [Config.GeospatialMode] is disabled, or if another full-space app uses Geospatial.
 *
 * Latitude and longitude are defined by the
 * [WGS84 specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System), and the altitude
 * value is defined by the elevation above the Earth's terrain (or floor) in meters.
 *
 * The rotation quaternion provided is with respect to an east-up-south coordinate frame. An
 * identity rotation will have the anchor oriented such that X+ points to the east, Y+ points up
 * away from the center of the earth, and Z+ points to the south.
 *
 * @param session the current [Session].
 * @param latitude the latitude of the anchor.
 * @param longitude the longitude of the anchor.
 * @param altitudeAboveSurface The altitude of the anchor above the given surface.
 * @param eastUpSouthQuaternion the rotation [Quaternion] of the anchor.
 * @param surface the [Surface] the anchor is attached to.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the latitude is outside the allowable range.
