/**
 * Represents the size of a volume in pixels.

 * This class provides a convenient way to store and manipulate the [width], [height], and [depth]
 * of a 3D volume in pixels. It also provides methods to convert to and from [Dimensions] in meters.
 *
 * Note: As with all [Int] values in Compose XR, the values in this class represent pixels.
 *
 * @property width the size of the volume along the x dimension, in pixels.
 * @property height the size of the volume along the y dimension, in pixels.
 * @property depth the size of the volume along the z dimension, in pixels. Panels have 0 depth and
 *   cannot be set to non-zero depth.
