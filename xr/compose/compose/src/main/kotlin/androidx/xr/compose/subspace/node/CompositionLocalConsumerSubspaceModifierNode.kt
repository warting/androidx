/**
 * Returns the current value of [local] at the position in the composition hierarchy of this
 * modifier's attached layout node.
 *
 * Unlike [CompositionLocal.current], reads via this function are not automatically tracked by
 * Compose. Modifiers are not able to recompose in the same way that a Composable can, and therefore
 * can't receive updates arbitrarily for a CompositionLocal.
 *
 * Because CompositionLocals may change arbitrarily, it is strongly recommended to ensure that the
 * composition local is observed instead of being read once. If you call [currentValueOf] inside of
 * a modifier callback like [SubspaceLayoutModifierNode.measure], then Compose will track the
 * CompositionLocal read. This happens automatically, because these Compose UI phases take place in
 * a snapshot observer that tracks which states are read. If the value of the CompositionLocal
 * changes, and it was read inside of the measure or draw phase, then that phase will automatically
 * be invalidated.
 *
 * For all other reads of a CompositionLocal, this function will **not** notify you when the value
 * of the local changes.
 *
 * This function will fail with an [IllegalStateException] if you attempt to read a CompositionLocal
 * before the node is [attached][SubspaceModifier.Node.onAttach] or after the node is
 * [detached][SubspaceModifier.Node.onDetach].
 *
 * @param local The CompositionLocal to get the current value of
 * @return The value provided by the nearest CompositionLocalProvider component that invokes,
 *   directly or indirectly, the composable function that this modifier is attached to. If [local]
 *   was never provided, its default value will be returned instead.
