 * An interface for creating entities with rendering features.

 * This interface is implemented by a [SceneRuntime] instance to provide rendering-specific entity
 * creation methods for use by a [RenderingRuntime] instance. By separating these methods into a
 * distinct interface, we avoid exposing internal rendering operations on the public [SceneRuntime]
 * API.
 *
 * The intended usage is for a [RenderingRuntime] to cast its [SceneRuntime] instance to
 * `RenderingEntityFactory` to access these factory methods.
