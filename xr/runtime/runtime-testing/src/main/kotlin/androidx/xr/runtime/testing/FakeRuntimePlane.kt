/**
 * Test-only implementation of [RuntimePlane]
 *
 * The properties of the [FakeRuntimePlane] can be set manually in order to simulate a runtime plane
 * in the environment.
 *
 * For example, for a [FakeRuntimePlane] with [Label.WALL], [Type.VERTICAL] and
 * [TrackingState.PAUSED]:
 * ```
 * val plane = FakeRuntimePlane(type = RuntimePlane.Type.VERTICAL,
 *                              label = RuntimePlane.Label.WALL,
 *                              trackingState = TrackingState.PAUSED)
 * ```
 *
 * And to modify the properties during the test:
 * ```
 * plane.apply {
 *     trackingState = TrackingState.TRACKING
 *     centerPose = Pose(Vector3(1f, 2f, 3f), Quaternion(0f, 0f, 0f, 1f))
 * }
 * ```
