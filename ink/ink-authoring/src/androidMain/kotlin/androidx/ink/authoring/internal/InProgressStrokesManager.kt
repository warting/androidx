/**
 * Accepts [MotionEvent] inputs for in-progress strokes, processes them into meshes, and draws them
 * to screen with as little latency as possible. This coordinates the majority of logic for the
 * public-facing [InProgressStrokesView].
 *
 * A term used throughout this and related classes is a "cohort" of strokes. It refers to a group of
 * strokes that are in progress simultaneously, and due to how low latency rendering works, **must**
 * be handed off from in-progress to finished HWUI rendering all at the same time to avoid a flicker
 * during the handoff. Two strokes are considered simultaneous and in the same cohort if they are
 * present on screen during the same HWUI frame, even if the first stroke was finished earlier in
 * the same frame than the second stroke was started. This can require a stroke to stay in progress
 * longer than it may seem like it should, but this cohort boundary is required because handoff
 * synchronization depends on HWUI frames while user inputs may happen multiple times per HWUI frame
 * without a guaranteed order.
