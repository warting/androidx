/**
 * An affine transformation in the plane. The transformation can be thought of as a 3x3 matrix:
 * ```
 *   ⎡m00  m10  m20⎤
 *   ⎢m01  m11  m21⎥
 *   ⎣ 0    0    1 ⎦
 * ```
 *
 * Applying the transformation can be thought of as a matrix multiplication, with the
 * to-be-transformed point represented as a column vector with an extra 1:
 * ```
 *   ⎡m00  m10  m20⎤   ⎡x⎤   ⎡m00*x + m10*y + m20⎤
 *   ⎢m01  m11  m21⎥ * ⎢y⎥ = ⎢m01*x + m11*y + m21⎥
 *   ⎣ 0    0    1 ⎦   ⎣1⎦   ⎣         1         ⎦
 * ```
 *
 * Transformations are composed via multiplication. Multiplication is not commutative (i.e. A*B !=
 * B*A), and the left-hand transformation is composed "after" the right hand transformation. E.g.,
 * if you have:
 * ```
 * val rotate = ImmutableAffineTransform.rotate(Angle.degreesToRadians(45))
 * val translate = ImmutableAffineTransform.translate(Vec(10, 0))
 * ```
 *
 * then `rotate * translate` first translates 10 units in the positive x-direction, then rotates 45°
 * about the origin.
 *
 * See [MutableAffineTransform] for mutable alternative to this class.
 *
 * @constructor Constructs this transform with 6 float values, starting with the top left corner of
 *   the matrix and proceeding in row-major order. Prefer to create this object with functions that
 *   apply specific transform operations, such as [scale] or [translate], rather than directly
 *   passing in the actual numeric values of this transform. This constructor is useful for when the
 *   values are needed to be provided all at once, for example for serialization. To access these
 *   values in the same order as they are passed in here, use [AffineTransform.getValues]. To
 *   construct this object using an array as input, there is another public constructor for that.
