 *   these instances will become the internal state of this [MutableTriangle], so modifications made
 *   to them directly or through setters on this [MutableTriangle] will modify the input
 *   [MutableVec] instances too. This is to allow performance-critical code to avoid any unnecessary

 *   code is unable to guarantee ownership of the nested mutable data at a particular time, it may
 *   be safest to construct this with copies of the data to give this [MutableTriangle] exclusive
 *   ownership of those copies.
