/**
 * Renders strokes to a [Canvas].
 *
 * Instead of calling the [draw] methods here directly, it may be simpler to pass an instance of
 * [CanvasStrokeRenderer] to [androidx.ink.rendering.android.view.ViewStrokeRenderer] and use it to
 * calculate transform matrix values.
 *
 * An example of how to use [CanvasStrokeRenderer.draw] directly:
 * ```
 * class MyView {
 *   // Update these according to app business logic, and call `MyView.invalidate()`
 *   val worldToViewTransform = Matrix() // Call e.g. `setScale(2F)` to zoom in 2x
 *   val strokesWithTransforms = mutableMapOf<Stroke, Matrix>()
 *
 *   private val strokeToViewTransform = Matrix() // reusable scratch object
 *   private val renderer = CanvasStrokeRenderer.create()
 *
 *   fun onDraw(canvas: Canvas) {
 *     for ((stroke, strokeToWorldTransform) in strokesWithTransforms) {
 *       // Combine worldToViewTransform (drawing surface being panned/zoomed/rotated) with
 *       // strokeToWorldTransform (stroke itself being moved/scaled/rotated within the drawing
 *       // surface) to get the overall transform of this stroke.
 *       strokeToViewTransform.set(strokeToWorldTransform)
 *       strokeToViewTransform.postConcat(worldToViewTransform)
 *
 *       canvas.withMatrix(strokeToViewTransform) {
 *         // If coordinates of MyView are scaled/rotated from screen coordinates, then those
 *         // scale/rotation values should be multiplied into the strokeToScreenTransform
 *         // argument to renderer.draw.
 *         renderer.draw(canvas, stroke, strokeToViewTransform)
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * In almost all cases, a developer should use an implementation of this interface obtained from
 * [CanvasStrokeRenderer.create].
 *
 * However, some developers may find it helpful to use their own implementation of this interface,
 * possibly to draw other effects to the [Canvas], typically delegating to a renderer from
 * [CanvasStrokeRenderer.create] for part of the custom rendering behavior to have the additional
 * effects add to or modify the standard stroke rendering behavior. Custom [CanvasStrokeRenderer]
 * implementations are generally less efficient than effects that can be achieved with a custom
 * [androidx.ink.brush.BrushFamily]. If a custom implementation draws to different screen locations
 * than the standard implementation, for example surrounding a stroke with additional content, then
 * that additional content will not be taken into account in geometry operations like
 * [androidx.ink.geometry.Intersection] or [androidx.ink.geometry.PartitionedMesh.computeCoverage].
