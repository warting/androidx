/**
 * Parameters that control stroke mesh rendering. Note: This contains only a subset of the
 * parameters as support is added for them.
 *
 * The core of each paint consists of one or more texture layers. The output of each layer is
 * blended together in sequence, then the combined texture is blended with the output from the brush
 * color.
 * - Starting with the first [TextureLayer], the combined texture for layers 0 to i (source) is
 *   blended with layer i+1 (destination) using the blend mode for layer i.
 * - The final combined texture (source) is blended with the (possibly adjusted per-vertex) brush

         *   are close to each other, but just large enough such that [animationFrames] <=
         *   [animationRows] * [animationColumns].
         * @param animationColumns Like [animationRows], but for columns.
         * @param animationDurationMillis The length of time in milliseconds that it takes to loop
         *   through all of the [animationFrames] frames in the texture. This means that each frame
         *   will be displayed (on average) for [animationDurationMillis] / [animationFrames]
         *   milliseconds. Defaults to 1000 milliseconds, but ignored if [animationFrames] is 1 (its
         *   default value) because that indicates that animation is disabled.
         * @param sizeUnit The units used to specify [sizeX] and [sizeY].
         * @param origin The origin point to be used for texture space.
         * @param mapping The method by which the coordinates of the [clientTextureId] image will
         *   apply to the stroke.
         * @param wrapX The wrap mode along the horizontal texture axis.
         * @param wrapY The wrap mode along the vertical texture axis.
         * @param blendMode The method by which the texture layers up to this one (index <= i) are
         *   combined with the subsequent texture layer (index == i+1). For the last texture layer,
         *   this defines the method by which the texture layer is combined with the brush color
         *   (possibly after that color gets per-vertex adjustments).
