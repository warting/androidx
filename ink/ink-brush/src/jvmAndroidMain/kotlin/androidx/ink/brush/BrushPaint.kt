/**
 * Parameters that control stroke mesh rendering. Note: This contains only a subset of the

 *
 * The core of each paint consists of one or more texture layers. The output of each layer is
 * blended together in sequence, then the combined texture is blended with the output from the brush
 * color.
 * - Starting with the first [TextureLayer], the combined texture for layers 0 to i (source) is
 *   blended with layer i+1 (destination) using the blend mode for layer i.
 * - The final combined texture (source) is blended with the (possibly adjusted per-vertex) brush
