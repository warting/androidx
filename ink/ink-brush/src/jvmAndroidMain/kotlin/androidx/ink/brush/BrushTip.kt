/**
 * A [BrushTip] consists of parameters that control how stroke inputs are used to model the tip
 * shape and color, and create vertices for the stroke mesh.
 *
 * The specification can be considered in two parts:
 * 1. Parameters for the base shape of the tip as a function of [Brush] size.
 * 2. An array of [BrushBehavior]s that allow dynamic properties of each input to augment the tip
 *    shape and color.
 *
 * Depending on the combination of values, the tip can be shaped as a rounded parallelogram, circle,
 * or stadium. Through [BrushBehavior]s, the tip can produce a per-vertex HSLA color shift that can
 * be used to augment the [Brush] color when drawing. The default values below produce a static
 * circular tip shape with diameter equal to the [Brush] size and no color shift.
