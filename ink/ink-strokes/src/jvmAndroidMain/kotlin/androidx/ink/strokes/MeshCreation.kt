/**
 * Creates a [PartitionedMesh] of the shape enclosed by the given [StrokeInputBatch] input points. A
 * typical use case is selecting a region of the scene and performing hit testing with the resulting
 * [PartitionedMesh].
 *
 * For a given stroke this algorithm aims to:
 * 1. Identify and create any connections that the user may have intended to make but did not fully
 *    connect.
 * 2. Trim any extra end points that the user did not intend to be part of the selected area.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * fun onStrokeFinished(stroke: Stroke) {
 *    val selectionRegion = stroke.inputs.createClosedShape()
 *    for (stroke in myScene.strokes) {
 *        if (stroke.shape.intersects(selectionRegion)) {
 *            myScene.setSelected(stroke, true)
 *        }
 *    }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @return The [PartitionedMesh] of the closed shape. If there are fewer than 3 input points, or if
 *   there are fewer than 3 points remaining after removing points with the same (x,y) coordinates
 *   as the previous point, this function will return a [PartitionedMesh] that is point-like (1
 *   point remaining) or segment-like (2 points remaining). The resulting mesh will have an area of
 *   0 but can still be used for hit testing via intersection.
 * @receiver The [StrokeInputBatch] to create a closed shape from.
