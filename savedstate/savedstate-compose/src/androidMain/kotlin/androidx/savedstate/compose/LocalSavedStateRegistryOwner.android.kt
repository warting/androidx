/**
 * The CompositionLocal containing the current [LocalSavedStateRegistryOwner].
 *
 * **Important:** For backward compatibility with Compose <= 1.7, we will use reflection to access
 * the [SavedStateRegistryOwner] from the older `androidx.compose.ui.platform` package on Android
 * targets. This will be cached for efficiency and has a included custom Proguard rule to prevent
 * obfuscation issues.
 *
 * When using Compose >= 1.8, the [SavedStateRegistryOwner] is directly accessed from the new
 * package.
 *
 * Please note that backward compatibility reflection may be removed once Compose >= 1.8 is stable.
 * A Gradle dependency constraint will be put in place to ensure smooth migration for clients.
