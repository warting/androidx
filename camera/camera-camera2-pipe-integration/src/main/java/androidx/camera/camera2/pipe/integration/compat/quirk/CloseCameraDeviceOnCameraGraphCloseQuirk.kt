/**
 * Quirk needed on devices where not closing the camera device can lead to undesirable behaviors,
 * such as switching to a new session without closing the camera device may cause native camera HAL
 * crashes, or the app getting "frozen" while CameraPipe awaits on a 1s cooldown to finally close
 * the camera device.
 *
 * QuirkSummary
 * - Bug Id: 282871038, 369300443, 425588561
 * - Description: Instructs CameraPipe to close the camera device before creating a new capture
 *   session to avoid undesirable behaviors
 *
 * TODO(b/270421716): enable CameraXQuirksClassDetector lint check when kotlin is supported.
