/**
 * Quirk that requires specific resolutions as the workaround.
 *
 * QuirkSummary Bug Id: 190203334 Description: The symptom of these devices is that the output of
 * one or many streams, including PRIV, JPEG and/or YUV, can have an unintended 25% crop, and the
 * cropped image is stretched to fill the Surface, which results in a distorted output. The streams
 * can also have an unintended 25% double crop, in which case the stretched image will not be
 * distorted, but the FOV is smaller than it should be. The behavior is inconsistent in a way that
 * the extra cropping depends on the resolution of the streams. The existence of the issue also
 * depends on API level and/or build number. See discussion in go/samsung-camera-distortion.
 * Device(s): Samsung Galaxy Tab A (2016) SM-T580, Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016) SM-J710MN, Samsung
 * Galaxy A3 (2017) SM-A320FL, Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime SM-G570M, Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime SM-G610F,
 * Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime SM-G610M
