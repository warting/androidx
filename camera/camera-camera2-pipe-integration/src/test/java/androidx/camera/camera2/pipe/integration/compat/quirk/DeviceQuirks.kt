/**
 * Tests version of main/.../DeviceQuirks.java, which provides device specific quirks, used for
 * device specific workarounds.
 *
 * In main/.../DeviceQuirks, Device quirks are loaded the first time a device workaround is
 * encountered, and remain in memory until the process is killed. When running tests, this means
 * that the same device quirks are used for all the tests. This causes an issue when tests modify
 * device properties (using Robolectric for instance). Instead of force-reloading the device quirks
 * in every test that uses a device workaround, this class internally reloads the quirks every time
 * a device workaround is needed.
