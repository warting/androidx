/**
 * This is a modified version of the [androidx.compose.foundation.AndroidEmbeddedExternalSurface]
 * composable.
 *
 * It has been adapted to:
 * - Remove functionality not required by the Viewfinder, such as direct callbacks for
 *   `onSurfaceCreated` and `onSurfaceDestroyed` with raw [Surface] objects.
 * - Add specific functionality to support the Viewfinder's API guarantees. Notably, it ensures that
 *   underlying surface resources are not released prematurely, but rather managed in coordination
 *   with the [androidx.camera.viewfinder.core.ViewfinderSurfaceSessionScope] to guarantee the
 *   surface is valid until the session scope is completed.
