/**
 * CameraPipeLifetime is an internal class designed to facilitate CameraPipe shutdown. It does so in
 * an ordered manner:
 * 1. First, we shut down the camera backends (which closes all cameras).
 * 2. Then we cancel coroutine scopes.
 * 3. Finally, with scopes cancelled, we shut down the threads CameraPipe created.
 *
 * Internal classes that require a CameraPipe-level shutdown routine should invoke
 * [addShutdownAction] to register their respective shutdown action and type.
