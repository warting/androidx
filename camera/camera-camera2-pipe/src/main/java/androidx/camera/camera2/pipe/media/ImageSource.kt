/**
 * An ImageSource produces images from a CameraStream via an [ImageSourceListener].
 *
 * This interface is an abstraction over [ImageReader] and [MultiResolutionImageReader] that is
 * designed to eliminate several subtle and difficult to avoid pitfalls that can occur when using
 * these classes directly.
 *
 * There are three common problems that occur when using an ImageReader with a camera:
 * 1. Closing the ImageReader before all outstanding Images are closed. This can lead to memory
 *    getting unexpectedly freed or overwritten, leading to corrupted outputs or difficult to
 *    diagnose crashes. Implementations are expected to avoid this problem by waiting to close the
 *    underlying ImageReader (after close has been called) until all images passed to the listener
 *    have also been closed.
 * 2. Acquiring too many images from an ImageReader (or failing to acquire images fast enough) can
 *    either lead to IllegalStateExceptions when attempting to read images out, or it can lead to
 *    stalling the Camera if images are not drained out fast enough. Implementations of this
 *    interface are expected to internally account for the number of outstanding images and to read
 *    and drop images that would otherwise exceed the maximum number of images.
 * 3. Using ImageReader.acquireLatestImage skips an arbitrary number of images. While this is
 *    primarily used to avoid stalling the camera, it also causes problems when attempting to
 *    associate metadata from the camera and can lead to stalls later on. Since this can be solved
 *    via #2, acquireLatestImage is not supported.
 *
 * Implementations are expected to be thread safe, and to associate each image with the [OutputId]
 * it is associated with.
