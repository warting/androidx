/**
 * PruningProcessingQueue is a data structure designed and optimized for parallel, high throughput,
 * continuous element processing operations. It handles the sequential aggregation, pruning and
 * processing of a running list of elements.
 *
 * PruningProcessingQueue is constructed and instructed with these notable parameters:
 * - [prune] gets a mutable list of elements and is expected to trim, remove elements that can be
 *   dropped, or reorder elements for those that have a higher priority. It is invoked whenever
 *   there's a new batch of element ready to be processed.
 * - [onUnprocessedElements] gets the list of elements that haven't been processed. It is invoked
 *   when the coroutine scope is cancelled, or whenever there was an exception taken place during
 *   processing.
 * - [process] is continuously and sequentially invoked with the next element to process. It is
 *   invoked only after the previous processing job is done.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * ```
 * class MyClass(scope: CoroutineScope) {
 *     private val processingQueue = ProcessingQueue<Int>(
 *         onUnprocessedElements = ::onUnprocessedElements
 *             prune = ::pruneInts
 *             process = ::processInt
 *         ).processIn(scope)
 *
 *     fun processAnInt(value: Int) {
 *         processingQueue.emitChecked(value)
 *     }
 *
 *     private fun pruneInts(items: MutableList<Int>) {
 *         println("Pruning: $items")
 *         items.removeAt(0)
 *     }
 *
 *     private suspend fun processInt(item: Int) {
 *         println("Processing: $item")
 *     }
 *
 *     private fun onUnprocessedElements(items: List<Int>) {
 *         println("Releasing unprocessed items: items")
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This class is thread safe.
