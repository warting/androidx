/**
 * ProcessingQueue handles the sequential aggregation and processing of a running list of elements.
 * It is designed to iteratively invoke the provided [process] function with a [MutableList] of
 * elements that have been aggregated from the previous iteration. [process] is guaranteed to be
 * invoked sequentially. [process] is expected to remove items from the [MutableList] that are no
 * longer needed (or that have been processed). Items that are not removed will be present in
 * subsequent [process] invocations.
 *
 * A key design consideration for this class, and the reason it does not operate on generic flows,
 * is the handling of unprocessed elements, which may need to be handled and/or closed. This is
 * non-trivial for buffered flows. [onUnprocessedElements] will be invoked synchronously with all
 * un-processed items exactly once if there is a non-zero number of unprocessed elements when the
 * ProcessingQueue scope is closed.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * ```
 * class MyClass(scope: CoroutineScope) {
 *   private val processingQueue = ProcessingQueue<Int>(
 *     onUnprocessedElements = ::onUnprocessedElements
 *     process = ::processInts
 *   ).processIn(scope)
 *
 *   fun processAnInt(value: Int) {
 *     processingQueue.emitChecked(value)
 *   }
 *
 *   private suspend fun processInts(items: MutableList<Int>) {
 *     val first = items.removeFirst()
 *     println("Processing: $first")
 *   }
 *
 *   private fun onUnprocessedElements(items: List<Int>) {
 *     println("Releasing unprocessed items: items")
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This class is thread safe.
